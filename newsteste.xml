            <descricao>A finished copy of a new "Fifty Shades" book told from hero Christian Grey's perspective has been stolen ahead of its release next week, its publisher said.</descricao>
            <corpo>London (CNN)A finished copy of a new "Fifty Shades" book told from protagonist Christian Grey's perspective has been stolen ahead of the novel's release next week, its UK publisher confirmed Thursday. Author E.L James announced plans on June 1 to publish the book, "Grey: Fifty Shades of Grey as Told by Christian." The scheduled release date -- June 18 -- coincides with the protagonist's birthday, as devoted fans of the "Fifty Shades" novels may know. The theft may prompt fears that extracts or details of the book will be leaked ahead of that date. A statement from the book's UK publisher, Penguin Random House UK, said: " 'Grey' will be published on June 18th -- Christian Grey's birthday -- as planned. "We can confirm that the Kent police are investigating the theft of a finished copy of E.L. James's new book 'Grey.' We will not be issuing any further statement." A spokeswoman for the Kent police, in southeastern England, said officers "are making inquiries after receiving a report that a book had been stolen on June 8." The novel is due to be published in the United States by Vintage Books, part of Random House. James said in a statement posted on her site last week that she had written the book after receiving requests from "thousands of readers" for Christian's point of view. "Christian is a complex character and readers have always been fascinated by his desires and motivations, and his troubled past. Also, as anyone who has ever been in a relationship knows, there are two sides to every story," James said. Anne Messitte, Vintage Books publisher and James' editor, was quoted on the website as saying the new book has "all the compelling attributes of its predecessors" and that she was excited for its readers. The trilogy of "Fifty Shades of Grey," "Fifty Shades Darker" and "Fifty Shades Freed" caught Hollywood's attention, and the first book was made into one of the most highly anticipated films of 2015. The film starred Jamie Dornan as Christian and Dakota Johnson as his love interest, Anastasia. It's made more than $166 million since its release on February 14. The sequel, "FIfty Shades Darker," is set to arrive in theaters in 2017.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Queen Elizabeth II celebrates her official birthday with a military parade and a flypast watched from the Buckingham Palace balcony by Prince George.</descricao>
            <corpo>London (CNN)Queen Elizabeth II marked her official birthday Saturday with a spectacular military parade and awards for actors, sportsmen and sportswomen, business leaders and community workers. The queen's actual birthday is on April 21 -- when the British monarch this year turned 89. But in line with tradition, her birthday is also celebrated on a summer Saturday when the weather is likely to be better for the parade, known as Trooping the Colour. The queen was joined by her husband, Prince Philip, and other members of the royal family for the ceremony in central London, led this year by the Welsh Guards. After the parade, the queen joined other members of the royal family on the balcony of Buckingham Palace for a flypast by the Royal Air Force. At that point, Prince George, now a month from his second birthday, stole the show as he made his first balcony appearance in the arms of his father, Prince William. His mother, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, earlier made her first public appearance since the birth of Princess Charlotte on May 2, riding in a carriage with Prince Harry and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. The queen's first Trooping the Colour was in 1953, shortly after her coronation. The queen also makes use of her official birthday to award honors to members of the public for their service to the nation. This year, recipients in the public eye include U.S. actor and director Kevin Spacey, recognized for his contribution over a decade as artistic director of the Old Vic theater in London; actor and charity fundraiser Lenny Henry; and Northern Irish musician Van Morrison. Another to be honored is journalist Caroline Criado-Perez, who in 2013 petitioned to have women displayed on British banknotes, prompting a storm of Twitter abuse.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Four foreign hikers fined and released Friday after they took nude photos at a mountain considered sacred in Malaysia.  </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Four foreign hikers who posed naked on Mount Kinabalu in Malaysia were freed Friday after they were fined and sentenced to time served. The backpackers -- from Britain, Canada and the Netherlands -- were arrested after stripping naked May 30 and posing for photos on the mountaintop, the nation's Bernama news agency reported. The mountain is considered sacred in Malaysia. They had pleaded guilty to "committing an obscene act." CNN has verified the identity of the two Canadians as Lindsey and Danielle Peterson. The Briton is named Eleanor Hawkins. The name of the Dutchman has not yet been confirmed by CNN.  The court in Kota Kinabalu on Friday evening fined the four 5,000 Malaysian ringgits, about $1,332, each and sentenced them to three days in prison. Taking into account the time served already, the court ordered them freed. Local residents had said their behavior caused the Kota Kinabalu earthquake this month, which killed 16 people. The indigenous people of Sabah believe the tourists disrespected local culture and angered the spirit of the mountain, Bernama reported. Among those who appeared in court was a British citizen who was arrested at the airport this week as she was about to leave for the capital of Kuala Lumpur. The other three turned themselves in. They could have faced three months in prison.  It is not the first time tourists have made headlines for stripping off their clothes at major attractions. Cambodia deported two U.S. tourists for allegedly taking nude pictures at Angkor Archaeological Park after a string of nudity-related incidents hit the religious sites this year. At least eight tourists were detained last year in separate incidents for getting naked and posing for photos in Machu Picchu, the 15th-century attraction in Peru.

            <corpo>(CNN)FIFA's communications director is stepping down, world soccer's embattled governing body said Thursday. The announcement came via a four-paragraph statement from the organization, and while the statement did not give a reason for Walter De Gregorio's departure, it made it sound as if the decision was the FIFA spokesman's alone. "Walter De Gregorio has decided to relinquish his office with immediate effect as Director of Communications &amp; Public Affairs. Mr. De Gregorio joined FIFA (in) September 2011 and will serve FIFA on a consultancy basis until the end of this year," it said. Several media outlets wondered aloud, however, if the former newspaperman's departure was tied to his recent appearance on Swiss television, where he made a joke at his employer's expense. The rough translation (De Gregorio spoke in Swiss-German), according to various sources, is as follows: Question: FIFA President Sepp Blatter, his spokesman and the secretary-general are all sitting in a car. Who's driving? Answer: The police. Deputy Director Nicolas Maingot will take over as interim director, FIFA said. "Walter has worked incredibly hard for the past four years and we are immensely grateful for all he has done. I am glad we will be able to continue to draw on his expertise until the end of the year," FIFA Secretary-General Jérôme Valcke said in a statement. Valcke is a focus in a probe into FIFA corruption after U.S. officials told The New York Times that he was linked to a $10 million bribe ahead of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Valcke has denied any wrongdoing. After the U.S. Justice Department unsealed a 47-count indictment detailing charges against nine FIFA officials and five others accused of racketeering, wire fraud and money laundering conspiracy, De Gregorio took to a podium in Zurich, Switzerland, last month to call it a good day for FIFA. "This for FIFA is good," he said. "It is not good in terms of image, and it's not good in terms of reputation, but in terms of cleaning up, in terms of everything that we did in the last four years." In the following week, Blatter would win re-election for a fifth term as president before announcing his resignation. Blatter has promised to step down as soon as FIFA can organize another election, which will be December at the earliest. In a Thursday vote, the European Parliament passed a resolution demanding zero-tolerance for corruption in football and calling for FIFA to replace Blatter immediately. "Parliament welcomes Joseph Blatter's resignation as FIFA president and calls on the federation to select an interim leader to replace him," a statement said, using the FIFA chief's first name. The resolution is not binding.  </corpo>

</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Walking the fine, greasy line between ewww and mmmm comes another hybrid snack that the world has somehow survived without until now: the dausage. The half donut, half sausage hybrid is the calorific brainchild of Wales-based Web developer Liam Bennett. Inspired by the successful cross-pastry donut splicings that gave us cronuts and cruffins, the 37-year-old is now producing a range of pork-based products laced with sweet fillings. These include sausages filled with raspberry jelly and -- the weak of stomach should look away now -- custard. "I was trying to think what else you could mix with a donut," Bennett tells CNN. "I was looking at things that go well with sweet things, duck with plum sauce. I thought I'd give the sausage a go because, well I eat sausages." Bennett says the reaction to his dausages was initially skeptical.  "Everyone thought it was crazy to be honest. But when they tried it they loved it. And so did I, I thought it was a great taste." Bennett is currently making his dausages by hand to sell at food fairs, but he's trying to raise funds via a Kickstarter to build the world's first dausage machine. He's also experimenting with other fillings. "We've also looked at more traditional flavors -- apple sauce with pork, mint with lamb -- but to be honest they're a bit boring, I'd rather go for newer flavors. "I think I would try anything." Wondering what's the etiquette for dishing up a dausage? Bennett says they're flexible. "I think it's multifunctional, we've had them at barbecues, hot dogs and things. You can have them with chips, with breakfast, with anything."  </corpo>

            <descricao>Warning: Click on this website that demystifies those three-letter airport codes and your workday be ruined.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Ever wondered why the designation for Vancouver International Airport is YVR? What the story is behind the ignominious SUX abbreviation for Sioux City, Iowa? Where those unique three-letter airport codes came from, anyway? No? Don't worry. A couple of airport trivia nuts have done all the thinking for you and set up a super-cool website explaining the origins of what are known as IATA (International Air Transport Association) Location Identifier Codes around the world. Launched on March 11 as the brainchild of a pair of friends in Arizona, Airport Codes has us diverting more time from work this week than our Facebook feeds or sneaking out for two-hour lunches. After working our way through most of the entries on the site, we reached out to creators Lynn Fisher, a designer and developer, and Nick Crohn, a software engineer, to get the story behind the stories behind airport codes. CNN: What's the inspiration for the site? Lynn Fisher: A few years ago I heard someone talk about the rationale behind airport codes and ever since I've found it interesting. After a Google search I realized there wasn't really a place that explained them all. So we decided to make a site that did just that. CNN: What's the goal of the site? Fisher: It's definitely just a fun project. We don't have any plans to commercialize it. We're happy with sharing the neat information we find. CNN: What's the response been so far? Nick Crohn: Since launching on March 11th, we've had about 245,000 visitors. Lots of people (and airports) have contributed via GitHub and tweeted codes at us. We are excited so many people have found it interesting and are working hard to keep up with the submissions. CNN: Which airport codes draw the most attention? Fisher: The Canadian airports are very popular because many of them don't seem to make any sense. CNN: Which have the most intriguing back stories? Fisher: One of my favorites is definitely SUX (Sioux City, Iowa). It's not a great code and after petitioning to change it twice, they decided to embrace it. Their slogan is "Fly SUX." Crohn: I'm going to go with ORD [Chicago's O'Hare International Airport]. I like how it's so different from O'Hare and hints at the airport's history. That's probably one of the things that's most enjoyable about the codes. They are keys to the airport's history. CNN: How did the whole three-letter code thing begin anyway? Fisher: Weather stations had unique two-letter identifiers and as airports grew and increased in number, they switched to three-letter codes. A podcast called "Layovers" recently talked more in-depth about this. Here's the link. At the bottom is the podcast and the time that part of the conversation happens. CNN: Are there any codes for which there isn't a reasonable explanation? Crohn: We're still pretty stumped about a lot of Canadian airport codes. We've reached out to a few and even they aren't sure where their codes came from. Some of them seem like a completely random pick. CNN: Can people contribute stories behind airports not listed on your site? Fisher: Yes! We have a long list of airports to add, and we're excited for every suggestion!  </corpo>

            <descricao>Prince Carl Philip of Sweden is marrying Sofia Hellqvist, a former model and reality TV star turned charity organizer, in Stockholm on Saturday.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's the stuff of modern-day fairy tales. A handsome Swedish prince is marrying his Cinderella on Saturday -- only this time, his bride-to-be is a former model and reality-TV star-turned-charity organizer. Prince Carl Philip, 36, who is third in line to the Swedish throne, will wed Sofia Hellqvist in the Royal Chapel at the Royal Palace of Stockholm. Swedish media reports have made much of 30-year-old Hellqvist's decidedly nontraditional past, including her appearance on the Swedish edition of reality TV show "Paradise Hotel" in 2005 and a reportedly risque photo shoot for Swedish men's magazine "Slitz." Hellqvist subsequently pursued business-related studies in New York and, while there, also qualified as a yoga instructor. She has more recently focused her efforts on charitable work. In 2010, she jointly founded the nonprofit organization Project Playground, which helps vulnerable children and young people in South Africa's townships. She remains honorary chairwoman of the charity, which also counts Prince Carl Philip as an honorary board member. To mark their wedding, the prince and Hellqvist have set up their own joint charitable venture, the Prince Couple's Foundation, again intended to help disadvantaged children, according to a palace news release. The guest list for the wedding includes royals from a half-dozen European nations and Princess Takamado of Japan. The wedding celebrations began with a private dinner for guests on Friday. After the ceremony on Saturday, guests will enjoy a banquet and dancing at the palace. The couple's engagement was announced in June last year. "We are looking forward to a summer wedding in the middle of June, when Sweden is extremely beautiful," they were quoted as saying then in a press release from the palace. "This will be a big day for us, and we are absolutely delighted."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Architects design 'world's tallest' wooden skyscraper - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Forget steel and concrete. A Canadian architecture firm has designed what they claim would be the world's tallest wooden building.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Forget steel and concrete. The new material of choice for skyscrapers could be wood if Canadian architect Michael Green has his way. Green's Vancouver-based MGA firm along with French architectural partners DVVD and real estate group REI France recently proposed what they claim would be the tallest wooden building in the world for Reinventer Paris, a design competition which sought new ideas for revitalizing architecture in the city. At 35-storeys tall, the tower at the center of the "Baobab" complex -- which also includes a student hotel, green space, bus station and e-car hub -- aims to help solve the French capital's housing challenges in a sustainable, creative and environmentally-friendly manner. Some within the project have even compared the concept to the Eiffel Tower in the iconic structures stakes. According to Green, the Eiffel Tower had a huge impact in inspiring architects to build with steel when it debuted as the world's tallest structure in 1889. Now he hopes Baobab can do the same. "Eiffel's vision redefined the skylines of the world, eventually (starting) the race for height in places like New York and Chicago in the 1920's and 30's and even... (in) new global cities in Asia and the Middle East today," Green told CNN via email. "We love the idea that a wood tower in Paris, however modest in some respects ... will help champion a new global wave of building with more sustainable, renewable and beautiful materials," he added.  The idea of a "plyscraper" may sound far fetched to those unfamiliar with the concept and there are currently no plans to construct the MGA building in Paris. But tall wooden buildings are an architectural development being given increasingly serious consideration in a number of locations around the world. Work is set to begin on the HoHo building, a 275-foot structure made almost entirely from wood in the Austrian capital of Vienna next year. Meanwhile, a 34-storey wooden apartment block could be built in Stockholm by 2023 if architecture firm C.F Moller has its way. MGA has already built the 97-foot tall Wood Innovation and Design Center in Prince George, Northern British Columbia. Other ambitious wood buildings have also sprung up in the likes of Australia and the United Kingdom too. The advantages of wood include its dexterity as a building material as well as its strong environmental credentials. Cross laminated timber -- a multiple panel wood product that is used to form the likes of walls, roof and floor panels -- in particular is has quickly established itself as a strong, reliable and popular wooden building material. "Wood, unlike steel and concrete, sequesters carbon dioxide, storing it away for the life of the building it is in," Green said. "As a renewable material grown by the power of the sun, wood offers us a new way to think about our future." Promotional literature relating to Baobab states it would store an estimated 3,700 metric tons of carbon dioxide. That's equivalent to keeping 2,207 cars off the road for a year or operating a home for 982 years, MGA state. The tower would also be constructed using a prefabricated construction method, where components are measured and built in a factory, often with space for doors, windows and wiring already carved into panels, before being rapidly transported and put together on site. This could potentially reduce cost, disruption and build time.  On the downside, however, critics say the drawbacks of large wooden structures include the potential for increased fire hazard and the fact that economies of scale are not quite there yet to make it massively cheaper than the likes of steel and concrete. Reports earlier this year suggested the Vienna fire department was liaising with the architectural firm behind the HoHo building to figure out how to minimize the blaze risk. Green confirms building such ambitious structures with timber would mean "reinventing wood; making it stronger, more fire safe, more durable and selecting material from sustainably managed forests." This last point is particularly relevant if wood is to fulfill its promise as a sustainable material. An efficient supply chain that replenished wood at a similar rate to which it was used would be a basic requirement. Then there are the difficulties of introducing new materials and designs into a model for building that's already relatively efficient and cost-effective. Leading timber specialist at the engineering group ARUP, Andrew Lawrence, told CNN earlier this year that shear walls -- the central core of tall buildings -- are likely to continue to be made from concrete and steel for the foreseeable future. Dollar-for-dollar as a pure construction material, he said, wood can still struggle to be cheaper than concrete. Green pointed out that all MGA wooden buildings so far have been built with "central elevator cores in mass timber." Although he added that the foundations have been made in concrete and steel has been used to make connections between the wood. However, Lawrence also pointed out that building with wood can still have its benefits if carefully planned out. "What you need to do if you want an economic wood solution is to think about all the aspects from outset," Lawrence says. "You will save on the program because it's all dry and is quick to erect and potentially, if you're making an office building, you can leave a lot of the wood exposed, saving on the cost and time of installing finishes." "If you leave the wood exposed, you can (also) have a really nice environment inside the building," he says. As Green and MGA suggest, there would better no location to put wood's aesthetic and structural fortitude to the test than the picturesque city of Paris. Read: The most ambitious luxury home ever?

            <descricao>A 15-year-old intern in England has discovered a new planet, the same size as Jupiter, while carrying out work experience at a university. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Advice to interns: work hard and make your mark. And if you can discover a new planet while you're at it, you could also be pushing the boundaries of our knowledge. Believe it or not, a 15-year-old boy did just that, according to Keele University in England, UK. While undertaking work experience at the university, Tom Wagg noticed a tiny dip in the light of a star as a planet passed in front of it -- that planet had supposedly not been on anyone's radar until then. The university said it has since taken two years to verify his findings. "I'm hugely excited to have a found a new planet, and I'm very impressed that we can find them so far away," Tom said, according to a statement from the university. He apparently spotted the planet by scouring the data collected by Keele University's WASP (Wide Angle Search for Planets) project, which scans millions of stars in night skies and searches for tiny dips, or transits, caused by the passing of planets. Nameless for the time being, the new planet has been labeled with the catalog number WASP-142b, as it's the 142nd discovery by the WASP collaboration. Invisible to the naked eye and 1,000 light years away, the planet is the same size as Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, but orbits its star in only two days. Such frequent orbits make such planets easier to find -- if you can describe the feat as easy. After the discovery of the planet, astronomers at the University of Geneva and the University of Liege confirmed that it had the required size and mass to be identified as a planet. And the university is planning a competition to find a name. A star student at a nearby school and a science enthusiast, Wagg had requested the work experience after learning that Keele University had a research group studying extrasolar planets, or exoplanets -- planets that exist around stars other than the sun. According to NASA, the first exoplanet was spotted in 1995 and 5,000 have been discovered ever since. The space agency says on its website that such findings provide hope in finding another Earth.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Austria, Swiss probe suspected spying in Iran talks - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Swiss and Austrian authorities are investigating claims of potential espionage during recent nuclear talks between Iran and world powers, officials said.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Swiss and Austrian authorities are investigating claims of potential espionage during recent nuclear talks between Iran and world powers, including the United States, officials from each nation said Thursday. The investigations started after Russian Internet security firm Kaspersky Lab said this week that it had uncovered a sophisticated cyberespionage weapon in use around the world, and specifically targeting hotels that hosted the nuclear talks. An Austrian Interior Ministry spokesman, Karl-Heinz Grundböck, would give no further details but said "all relevant locations" are being investigated. The Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland said it had "opened criminal proceedings against persons unknown on suspicion of political espionage." A house was searched May 12 in Geneva, it said, "and IT hardware as well as software has been seized. The aim of the aforementioned house search was to seize respective information as well as the malware; it was of particular interest to investigate whether the malware infected the respective IT systems." Neither country has said who it believes to be behind the suspected espionage. Kaspersky Lab said the attacks involved a virus dubbed Duqu 2.0, which exploits software vulnerabilities to infiltrate and gather information. Based on the sophistication, it's clear the virus was part of a state-sponsored attack, said David Emm, senior security researcher at Kaspersky Lab. So who was behind it? "Trying to specifically say which government might be involved is impossible," Emm said. Even if the evidence seems to point toward one country, he said, that doesn't mean it's accurate. "It is so easy for an attacker to leave false flags, if you like, to set a false trail of breadcrumbs leading to somebody else's door," he said.  An earlier version of the Duqu virus has been linked to Israel. And The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Israel had obtained confidential information about the closed-door negotiations to help it argue against a potential deal. Israel strongly denied the report, however. "These allegations are utterly false," a senior official in the Israeli Prime Minister's office told CNN at the time. "The state of Israel does not conduct espionage against the United States or Israel's other allies." Asked Thursday about the allegations of potential espionage, Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Emmanuel Nahshon told CNN that the ministry had no comment. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also declined to comment. Earlier Thursday, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely told Israel Army Radio there was "no basis to all the international reports about the involvement of Israel in this affair." She added, "What is far more important is that we will prevent a bad agreement, or else at the end of the day, we will find ourselves with an Iranian nuclear umbrella."  The Israeli government's use of the information it allegedly gleaned -- sharing it with U.S. lawmakers and others to undercut support for a deal -- angered the White House, the Journal said in its report, citing current and former U.S. officials. On Thursday, several U.S. officials told CNN that the Obama administration doesn't doubt reports accusing Israel of using the virus to spy on the Iran talks. Espionage during the talks is nothing new, one official said. "They do it all the time," the official said. "They did it last year, and they did it again this year. This doesn't come as any great surprise to anyone." The talks involved the so-called P5+1, made up of the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany, across the table from Iran. The negotiations, which wrapped up in the Swiss city of Lausanne in April, resulted in a framework deal that was backed by the White House but opposed by Netanyahu and many in the U.S. Congress. The parties have until the end to June to work out the details and put the plan to paper. CNN's Phil Black, Max Foster, Catherine E. Shoichet, Jethro Mullen, Evan Perez, Elise Labott and Oren Liebermann contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Hypersomnia: The woman who was always tired - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>It's very rare, and incredibly debilitating. Idiopathic hypersomnia is an illness that means you're always exhausted.</descricao>
            <corpo>Vital Signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world. Atlanta, Georgia (CNN)You know the feeling -- groggy and tired, not fully awake, not fully aware. We all get this way now and then when we're sleep deprived but for Danielle Hulshizer, it's a constant way of life. Hulshizer suffers from idiopathic hypersomnia -- a sleep disorder where the feeling of sleepiness never wears off, even after sleeping all night and taking long naps during the day. It has interfered with her education, career, relationships -- her entire life. "If I had a nickel for every time somebody (would) come up to me and go, 'oh you should go home and sleep -- you look so tired,' I swear I'd be a billionaire right now," says Hulshizer. Sleep isn't restful for Hulshizer: "You don't wake up feeling energized and ready to go," she says, "you wake up feeling just as tired as you did 12 hours before when you laid down to go to sleep in the first place."  For a long time, Hulshizer's constant craving for sleep was blamed on her busy schedule as a child when she was a competitive figure skater. "I would be skating from 2.30 in the morning to 7.30, then go to school, after that cheerleading practice, then homework and then back to the rink for more training," she says. "It honestly never occurred to me that there was an issue until moving to Georgia and having all these outside people who didn't know me as a competitive skater tell me there's something wrong -- 'you keep falling asleep.'" Read this: The 'snoring sickness' that leaves you gasping for breath After signing up for a sleep study 14 years ago she was diagnosed with hypersomnia. The initial treatment plan was stimulant medication to keep Hulshizer awake. At first it worked but after a few years she started developing migraines and tremors and eventually felt tired again. Life for her and her fiancée Scott was starting to take its toll. "Living together there have been times where it's been so bad that in order to get her out of bed in the morning, I've literally had to pick her up physically and set her on her feet to see if she'd stand. Sometimes she did, sometimes she'd slump down to the floor," Scott says. In Hulshizer's case, the stimulants she was relying on to stay awake were wearing off. She was getting desperate. But there was hope. "It felt like rock bottom," she says, "(The) light at the end of the tunnel would be meeting Dr. Rye and realizing I wasn't the only one out there going through this."  Dr. David Rye is a neurologist at the Emory Clinic Sleep Center in Atlanta, Georgia. He specializes in hypersomnia cases, like Hulshizer's. After years of research, Dr Rye and his team found that some patients have a hyper sensitivity to a naturally occurring sedative in the brain, known as GABA. Essentially, the hyperactivity of GABA in a patient's system acts as a "parking brake," no matter how much "acceleration" is applied from stimulants. They discovered that a drug called Flumazenil, sometimes used to help bring people out of anesthesia, can overcome the GABA abnormality in patients like Hulshizer. But the medication, although used in other parts of the world, isn't approved by the FDA for treatment of hypersomniacs. Two years ago, Hulshizer became only the second person in the United States to get Flumazenil for hypersomnia. Hulshizer was asked by Dr. Rye to trial the drug to test its efficacy: it turned out to be an instant game-changer. "Within 15 minutes of placing the tablets under my tongue, that wall that I felt lived in my brain my entire life was just gone," Hulshizer says. "It crumbled and I was able to think clearly and communicate and talk and hold a conversation with somebody without having to look at them. "It was incredible -- it actually made me feel for the first time like I was alive." Hulshizer now takes Flumazenil in the form of a slow-release skin cream. It helps her feel awake -- not just stay awake. "I feel like a whole person now," she says. "I have been lucky to have Scott in my life as well as my amazing family and without their love and support I never would have found Dr. Rye, I never would have found this treatment and found how to live."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Can Uber-style apps make hiring private jets a reality? - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Here's the scenario:</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Here's the scenario: The business meet wraps up in Boston, now an urgent situation is developing in Los Angeles. A quick check of flight schedules reveals there's a premium-rate business-class seat available. However, the flight doesn't depart until first thing tomorrow. But hang on, there's another option. A private jet, leaving when you want it to leave. And it's cheaper too. Seriously. In the wake of Uber's shake-up of the taxi market and AirBnB's impact on accommodations, that most exclusive industry of all, executive aviation, could soon be disrupted in the same way. So does that mean that ordinary business travelers could soon be switching to low-cost private aircraft in the same way they've been switching to cheaper, convenient cabs across town? Some aviation entrepreneurs think so. They're creating simple, sleek mobile apps to optimize spare capacity in the private jet market and create a smooth booking experience. Obviously private aviation isn't going to be for the masses, but what if this exclusive preserve of the super-rich is about to become accessible to the merely affluent -- those that today fill the front cabin section of commercial aircraft? Instead of calling a broker or buying into shared exec jet ownership, these new apps allow travelers to secure a private aircraft with just a few clicks and no membership fees. Online marketplaces like Jetsmarter, Victor or Ubair rely on complex predictive algorithms to aggregate aircraft availability data from hundreds of private jet operators and provide quotes within seconds.  "We are a high tech big data company at core," says Sergey Petrossov, Jetsmarter's founder, adding that most of his company's clients are newcomers to executive aviation. Petrossov sees a future where the executive jet industry goes the way of the Uber-reshaped taxi market. He believes apps could even become so efficient that prices drop to the point where private aircraft not only take business from traditional operators and airlines, but from road transport. Fleets of small propeller aircraft could lure people away from cars and into the skies. Richard Koe, managing director of aviation market intelligence consultancy WINGX, is more cautious. Yes, some new players are streamlining the booking process, he says, but that might not be enough to bring prices down to levels that'll open up private flights to greater numbers.  Koe instead thinks the online players might simply end up taking business from traditional brokers rather than disrupt the industry's structure. They could, however, offer an efficient solution to the problem of so-called empty legs. These happen when private jets fly without passengers as operators reposition them. According to some industry estimates, empty legs account for more than a third of all private flights. Jetsuite, a light-jet operator based in California, pioneered discounted online sales of empty legs and others have followed suit. Jetsmarter even offers empty legs for free to clients signing up for its optional membership plan. There's a major drawback though. The rigid and unpredictable nature of empty legs doesn't really suit the flexibility needs of the private jet crowd. While heavily discounted "empty leg" flights make for excellent marketing material, only a fraction of those actually end up being sold. With on-demand charters still the bread and butter of exec aviation marketplaces, it's in precisely this area that digitization can make a difference by adding extra layers of transparency. Which is why Victor, a UK-based company that's just closed an $8 million funding round to expand in the United States, has decided to make of transparency its chief selling point. Normally, passengers calling a broker would be told very little about the aircraft they're hiring -- nothing about the plane type, the operator or the commission they're being charged, says Victor's founder and CEO Clive Jackson. By making all these details available through its website and app, Victor hopes to build long-term trust-based relationships with its clients.  Other players are experimenting with new pricing models instead. JetMe offers a reverse-auction feature on its website and app. Customers enter the destination and dates of their flight on Jetme's website or app and are given a tentative quote based on an analysis of market prices. They're then given the option to submit their own bid. Jetme's system is smart enough to tell users what chances their bid has of being accepted by aircraft operators, allowing them to make a more informed decision on whether to submit it. California-based Surfair and its East Coast equivalent, Beacon, are proposing an entirely different model: a flat fee all-you-can-fly membership. Members pay a monthly fee ($1,750 for Surfair, $2,000 for Beacon) that allows them to fly as many times as possible on certain routes. This model is more akin to that of scheduled airlines than to that of executive jet charter operators, since flights are limited to a number of trunk routes and passengers share the aircraft with other travelers. However, this might suit the needs of ultra-frequent fliers who find themselves commuting between two given cities, let's say, New York and Boston, several times per week. Beacon CEO Wade Eyerly claims this way of flying has helped seal many business deals, as the flights provide a perfect venue for professional networking. Those that do not mind sharing the ride with strangers can also use BlackJet. Launched in 2012 with the backing of some A-list celebrities, BlackJet has been recently repositioned as a marketplace for private jet seats after undergoing some financial turbulence.  Blackjet lets members book seats, at a significant discount, on private flights that've already been scheduled but are not flying at full capacity. The limitation, as in the case of empty legs, is that passengers are dependent on aircraft being available on their route and time of choice. Pere Suau-Sanchez, a lecturer in air transport management at the UK's Cranfield University, says this tradeoff between cost and flexibility, together with the fact that many airlines have been busy improving their first- and business-class products to keep top-tier corporate clients, could be a significant obstacle when it comes to attracting new customers. So which one of these models will last? Will there be a winner-takes-all scenario or a more fragmented market, with each player catering to the needs of specific market segments? The jury is out. If what happened to other industries after going digital is any guide, we might see a significant degree of consolidation among these marketplaces, perhaps with smaller players holding their ground by catering to niche markets and offering different business models. The democratization of private flying has proven elusive so far and it's likely to remain a challenging proposition. However, if just one of these ambitious aviation entrepreneurs manages to get their way, the super-rich might soon have to start looking for new, more unassailable, status symbols.

            <cabecalho>Lost comet lander Philae sends 'hello' from space - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Philae is alive! The lost comet lander from the Rosetta spacecraft signals ESA's operations center in Germany.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's alive! Many moons ago, a small space probe named Philae skipped across the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko when the lander's harpoon-like anchoring mechanism failed. It came to rest in a shady spot and, without enough sunlight to keep it powered, it fell asleep after about 60 hours of operation. Mission scientists had been trying to pinpoint its location since November -- until late Saturday. At 10:28 p.m., the European Space Agency's operations center in Darmstadt, Germany, just south of Frankfurt, received a signal from Philae, which transmitted more than 300 data packets. Those have been analyzed at the Lander Control Center at the German Aerospace Center, which dubbed Philae's emergence from its seven-month slumber a "'hello' from space." "Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35ºC and has 24 watts available," Philae project manager Stephan Ulamec said in a statement. "The lander is ready for operations." To hear Twitter tell it, Philae's comet-chasing mothership, Rosetta, was delighted to hear from the little lander but reluctant to let it delve back into work too hastily after its long sleep. Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter "Hello @ESA_Rosetta! I'm awake! How long have I been asleep? #Lifeonacomet," came the tweet from Philae's handle. "Hello @Philae2014! You've had a long sleep, about 7 months!" Rosetta responded. "Wow @ESA_Rosetta! That's a long time... time for me to get back to work! #Lifeonacomet" "@Philae2014 Need to check you're fit, healthy and warm enough first @philae2014! Take it easy for now :)" "Oh, OK @ESA_Rosetta! I'm still a bit tired anyway... talk to you later! Back to #lifeonacomet!" Months after Philae nodded off, lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needed almost 6 watts of power to reboot itself, 9 watts to accept communications and 19 watts to allow two-way communication with the orbiter -- not a great deal of power when you consider energy-saving lightbulbs use 20 watts or fewer. There was speculation in March that Philae could be awake but lacking the necessary power to communicate with Rosetta, which was in orbit around Comet 67P looking for the washing machine-sized lander. Scientists sent "blind commands" in hopes that the lander could process the instructions even if it couldn't respond, O'Rourke told CNN in March. But there was not immense confidence that Philae could be revived. Asked his thoughts Sunday, O'Rourke told CNN he was "thrilled" contact was re-established, which "allows us to do more science." "We are all delighted -- delighted that Philae survived the long winter. It's a great opportunity," he said. When the lander snapped its hibernation spell Saturday, it "spoke" with the scientists on the ground for 85 seconds, ESA said. "We have also received historical data -- so far, however, the lander had not been able to contact us earlier," Ulamec said, explaining that Philae must have been awake before Saturday night. Scientists eagerly anticipate Philae's next contact, as the lander's memory still contains more than 8,000 data packets that will tell them what has happened in recent days on Comet 67P. Since March 12, Rosetta has been listening for the lander to determine if it had survived the cold, dark recesses of the comet. Scientists promised that if enough sunlight could fall on Philae's solar panels, it could be revived. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. The mishap, said scientists, could prove to be a happy accident. Had Philae touched down in its original landing spot, O'Rourke explained, the temperatures as the comet neared the sun could have burned out the lander's electronics, killing it altogether. But because it found shade -- beneath a cliff face, scientists deduced from images sent by the lander -- it was able to survive. Now, scientists are excited at the prospect of Philae witnessing a remarkable show as 67P makes its closest approach to the sun in August. "I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point," O'Rourke has said. ESA has led the consortium, which includes NASA, to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun. The mission is already changing perceptions of comets. Instead of thinking of a comet as a dirty snowball, O'Rourke has said, he now thinks of a comet as an "icy dirtball." He also described discoveries of dust and large "boulders" circling the comet after they were blown off by the sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football field that has been lifted and deposited next to the hole. "The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery," he said. CNN Interactive: Rosetta and its mission Opinion: How comet mission helps search for alien life  </corpo>

            <descricao> An amazing Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner video shows impressive takeoff and turns before the Paris Air Show. </descricao>
            <corpo>CNN's team at the Paris Air Show will be hosting a live Twitter chat with some of the biggest names in aviation. On June 15, at 11 a.m. ET [15:00 GMT,] CNN's resident aviation geek Thom Patterson will be discussing the future of flight with Solar Impulse pilot Bertrand Piccard; Chris Daniels, Director of Hybrid Air Vehicles; Brett Snyder, aka The Cranky Flier and Tim Robinson, Editor in Chief of Aerospace magazine. (CNN)There's a famous quote: "If you did it, it ain't braggin'." Boeing did it -- in front of a camera. An eyepopping rehearsal video Boeing released Thursday shows off its newest version of the Dreamliner aircraft — the 787-9 — performing some impressive and beautiful banks and ascents. The takeoff alone will get your attention. So maybe it's not bragging, but the flight certainly qualifies as world-class swagger for the Dreamliner, which is scheduled for a performance next week at the Paris Air Show. Watch these breathtaking "technical maneuvers" — as Boeing calls them — while the Vietnam Airlines plane soars over Moses Lake, Washington. CNN asked Boeing to share specifics about the takeoff and banking angles during the flight. The company preferred to keep aviation geeks guessing. A spokeswoman told CNN "we unfortunately aren't sharing specifics about the profile such as bank angles at this time." It's aviation eye candy to be sure, but an airline pilot warns that we shouldn't be too impressed. "Some of what you're seeing on takeoff is a trick of perspective," said 767 pilot Patrick Smith. "It looks like the takeoff is at a near vertical 90 degree angle — trust me it's not." Typically, when passengers are on board, "a 20 degree pitch-up on takeoff is pretty strong," said Smith, who also blogs on aviation at AskthePilot.com. Related: What to watch for at the Paris Air Show "Presumably the plane was very light because it wasn't carrying any passengers, probably had a very light fuel load, no freight, so it would have been able to perform a steeper than normal ascent — but not to the extent the video seems to show," Smith said. "But for demonstration purposes, under lightweight conditions, it's perfectly natural for this airplane to do that. It's nothing dangerous." Inside the cockpit during the rehearsal, Smith said, the pilots may have been offering verbal cues to each other while keeping an eye on the airspeed, rate of climb, altitude — and on a 787, all these things are combined on the same display screen. "If they're pushing the envelope and having fun, they might be going a bit past what the command bars are showing, but just temporarily — again, it's the Paris Air Show!" The video lit up Twitter. Actor Rob Lowe's tweet asked how "sh*tty are the seats?" And @KJMidday wrote: "My mouth literally dropped open." The Dreamliner family has been the darling of aviation enthusiasts around the world since the first version debuted in 2011. Its lightweight, fuel-saving superstrong carbon fiber materials and other cutting edge design features were touted as the future of the airline industry. The dash-9, the latest version of the Dreamliner, first rolled off the assembly line in Everett, Washington, in 2013 and was delivered to its first customer, New Zealand Airlines, the next year. It's longer and has a longer range than its predecessor, the 787-8. The next Dreamliner, the 787-10, is expected to begin commercial service in 2018.  </corpo>

The match at the Polijud Stadium in Split was already being played behind closed doors as punishment to the hosts for previous incidents involving its fans, but the few present and viewers on television could clearly see the notorious symbol. Ground staff made largely unsuccessful efforts at halftime to remove the swastika sign. It was unclear if it had been mowed into the grass or placed there by other means. The game finished 1-1, to leave Croatia top of Group H by two points from Italy, but it could face further sanction by European governing body UEFA.  Tomislav Pacak, a spokesman for the home federation, issued a statement about the incident on its official website Saturday. "We apologize to all viewers, our guests from Italy and the players from both teams, for the Nazi symbol on the Poljud Stadium grass," he said. "We have immediately notified UEFA of the incident. "This was an obvious act of sabotage and a criminal act. We condemn it and ask the police and judicial bodies to find the person(s) responsible for what is a shame not only for Croatian football, but the entire country. Read: Croatia star banned from World Cup for 'Nazi Chants' "Once again, we express regret and condemn this act, and we apologize to all the viewers, guests and players from both teams." Pacak claimed that a "chemical agent" had been used on the pitch, 24 to 48 hours before kickoff, timed to be visible during the qualifying match. The stadium is the home of Croatian top-flight side Hajduk Split.  UEFA is yet to give its official reaction to the incident, but had ordered the qualifier to be played in an empty stadium as punishment for fan violence and racist incidents when Croatia played Norway earlier in the qualifying campaign. The crucial top of the table clash had seen Mario Manzukic put the home side ahead after 11 minutes, but Lazio's Antonio Candreva leveled from the penalty spot before halftime for Italy. Read: Flare-up in the San Siro The earlier fixture between the two sides in Milan had also ended 1-1 last November and was marred by crowd trouble, with the match temporarily halted after rocket flares were fired on to the San Siro pitch by visiting fans.  Friday's other major talking point in the Euro qualifying campaign was confined to the pitch, where a fine goal from Real Madrid's Gareth Bale gave Wales an upset 1-0 win over FIFA second-ranked Belgium in Cardiff. Bale, making his 50th appearance for Wales, scored in the first half and the home side held out against sustained Belgian pressure after the break. It leaves Wales three points clear of Belgium at the top of Group B and set to qualify for the finals of a major competition for the first time since the World Cup of 1958.  Saturday's qualifying action saw Cristiano Ronaldo score his third successive hat-trick as Portugal edged Armenia 3-2 to consolidate its position on top of Group I. Brazilian-born midfielder Marcos Pizzelli put Armenia into a shock lead before Ronaldo leveled from the penalty spot and then added two more in the second half. He came into the international off the back of two hat-tricks for his club side Real Madrid. Tiago was red-carded for Portugal and the home side grabbed a second through Hrayr Mkoyan, but the group leaders held on for three valuable points. Robert Lewandowski also scored a hat-trick for Poland as it stayed top of the competitive Group D with a 4-0 home win over Georgia. Remarkably, the Bayern Munich striker was credited with scoring the triple in just the last two minutes of the match as the visitors defense collapsed. Germany's Andre Schuerrle rounded off the day's hat-tricks as he helped himself to three goals in Germany's 7-0 rout of minnow Gibraltar as the World Cup winners moved to second behind the Poles. Earlier, Scotland drew 1-1 in the Republic of Ireland to boost its hopes of reaching the finals in France.  </corpo>

            <descricao>You'll want to book a window seat if you're flying into any of these 10 airports.  </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)For jaded air travelers, window seats are overrated. Not having to climb over snoring seat mates to get to the toilet often trumps the desire to gaze at fluffy white clouds and brown squares of farmland as the plane descends. There are, however, exceptions. PrivateFly, a global booking platform for private jet charters, has just released the results of its 2015 global survey of the world's most scenic airport approaches. When you're flying into these 10 beauties, which offer views of everything from mountainous landscapes to glittering skyscrapers, you're going to want to be in that window seat. New Zealand's Queenstown Airport came out the big winner, followed by Las Vegas McCarran Airport and Nice Cote D'Azur Airport in France. The PrivateFly Best Airport Approaches 2015 poll was conducted in March and April of this year and received more than 3,000 individual votes, says the company. A total of 147 global airports received nominations. "Our poll has become an annual checklist for the well-traveled, and offers a fascinating mix of global descents," says Adam Twidell, CEO of PrivateFly and an experienced pilot. "From iconic city views such as Las Vegas and London City; to tiny remote airstrips such as Saba in the Caribbean (the world's shortest commercial runway); and the unique beach landing at Barra in the Outer Hebrides." Here are the top 10 scenic airport approaches, according to PrivateFly's 2015 survey. 1. Queenstown Airport, New Zealand 2. Las Vegas McCarran Airport, United States 3. Nice Cote D'Azur Airport, France 4. Barra Airport, Scotland, UK 5. St. Maarten Airport (Princess Juliana International), Caribbean 6. Saba Airport (Juancho E Yrausquin), Caribbean Netherlands 7. Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, Canada 8. Gibraltar Airport, UK 9. London City Airport, UK 10. Cape Town Airport, South Africa Previous winners of the annual poll include Nice Cote D'Azur (2014); St. Maarten in the Caribbean (2013) and Barra in Scotland's Outer Hebrides (2012).

            <cabecalho>Actor Christopher Lee dies at 93 - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Christopher Lee, the British actor famed for his turns as Dracula, a Bond villain and as the wizard Saruman in the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy, has died.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Christopher Lee, the actor, was often the villain. He played Dracula, the bad guy in the James Bond thriller "The Man with the Golden Gun," the deliciously evil wizard Saruman in the "Lord of the Ring" films, and the dude who fought Yoda with a lightsaber in "Star Wars: Attack of the Clones." But Sir Christopher Lee, the man, who died this week at the age of 93? Not an ounce of villain to be found, fans and fellow actors alike said Thursday. "You were an icon, and a towering human being with stories for days," "Lord of the Rings" co-star Elijah Wood tweeted Thursday. "We'll miss you." Lee died Sunday, a spokesman for the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea said. He had more than 150 film credits to his name, beginning in 1948 and stretching into this decade. Lee initially made his name in horror films. His first major horror role was as Frankenstein's creature and then the infamous vampire Dracula in a series films for Britain's Hammer Films studios from the 1950s until the 1970s. He was often quoted as saying he had to be talked into playing in some of the Dracula films. He said he played the character silently in one film -- 1965's "House of Horrors" -- because the lines were so bad. Later, he took on the role of James Bond's nemesis Francisco Scaramanga in 1974's "The Man with the Golden Gun," and was introduced to a new generation of film-goers in 2001 with "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring." In it, he played the evil wizard Saruman, former mentor to Gandalf -- the good-guy wizard's role Lee said he once coveted but had grown too old to play. The next year, he entered the "Star Wars" universe as the fallen Jedi knight, Count Dooku, in the "Star Wars: The Clone Wars." Both series brought him renewed fame and acclaim, but for Lee, two roles always stood out: His 1973 turn as Lord Summerisle in the cult classic "The Wicker Man," and his portrayal of the founder of Pakistan, Mohammed Ali Jinnah, in the 1998 film, "Jinnah." "The most important thing I've ever done," he said in a 2011 forum at the University College Dublin. Lee was knighted in 2009 -- fittingly on the day before Halloween -- for his accomplishments in the arts. Two years later, the British Academy of Film and Television Arts awarded Lee its highest honor, the Academy Fellowship. BAFTA CEO Amanda Berry expressed sorrow Thursday at the passing of Lee, whom she called a "truly talented and versatile actor." "His biography, and therefore his legacy, is one that many in the film industry can only dream of," Berry said. In 2011, Lee said that he always wanted to bring something unexpected to his roles. "One thing to me is very important, if you're playing somebody that the audience regards as, let's say evil, try to do something they don't expect, something that surprises the audience," he said. In his last few years, he did just that for many fans: he turned to a heavy metal career, releasing the holiday albums "A Heavy Metal Christmas" and "A Heavy Metal Christmas Too" in 2012 and 2013 -- endearing himself to yet another group of fans, many of whom reacted to the news of his death with an outpouring of celebration and sadness. "The great, always criminally underrated Sir Christopher Lee has left us," actor Mark Gatiss wrote on Twitter. "A Titan of Cinema and a huge part of my youth. Farewell."

            <corpo>Traders highlights the business of global trading by showcasing extraordinary individuals worldwide who are trading goods and services across borders. Toledo, Spain (CNN)The sweet sounds of Spanish guitars have serenaded music lovers for hundreds of years, reaching audiences far beyond their home country. But now one company wants to move the music back to its roots. Based in the foothills outside Toledo, Spain, Manuel Rodriguez guitars are exported all over the world -- inspiring Flamenco music in Japan and sounding out Latin styles in South America. They are exported to 120 countries and are played by musicians including Carlos Santana and Stevie Wonder. At the moment most of the 15,000 guitars they make annually are industrially produced in China, where they are assembled in one month and sold for around $200. But each year, 5,000 guitars are also made in Spain, crafted from a variety of woods such as African ebony, Canadian cedar and Indian rosewood. These models can fetch up to $20,000 each. "A $20,000 guitar would take about three to four months -- so you put so much passion, love in that instrument you feel ashamed to sell it," says Manuel Rodriguez, the third generation owner of the company. He says his is the second-oldest guitar brand in the world, and now he plans to bring the production of its low-price guitars back from China to their historic home of Spain. "People will buy more our instruments made in Spain than made in China," says Rodriguez. "In China the labor is going up, so it's going be difficult to compete and I think that's our next challenge is to express and to show the Spanish guitar is back in Spain."

            <corpo> (CNN)Tough, strong and noble; these are the sorts of qualities one would expect from a national symbol. The fabled Karabakh horse is a rare and beautiful animal that is of great importance to Azerbaijanis. But the country's national animal that can be found everywhere from its stories to its postage stamps is faced with extinction. In the thickly forested foothills of Sheki, a small city 300km (187 miles) from the capital Baku, is one of world's largest and purest Karabakh herds. Their owner, Yashar Guluzade, has been restoring the breed for over a decade in this unspoilt mountainous region. He says that conflict and a difficult economic situation have led to their decline. "At the beginning of the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict the horses were continually transferred from one place to another and this was one of the reasons for the sharp reduction of stock as the movement of pregnant mares led to miscarriages," he explained. Guluzade says that the places the horses were taken did not have the correct conditions and pastures to support them and it was as if the country had forgotten about them. The government has now stepped in to try and protect the breed. Azerbaijan's Ministry of Agriculture has drawn up a number of horse breeding programs and the law states the animal cannot be exported for sale. The ministry says it may consider selling the horses in the future to raise money for their upkeep but for now the focus is on breeding and protection. Khandan Rajabli, the managing director of the ministry's breeding division told CNN that these programs include improving veterinary services, training and scientific studies on the horses' DNA. "Instituting a system of identification like passports to track the breed has been established" he said. Rajabli says that a German company is also assisting with gene research and establishing the horses genetic profiling so a system can be developed to confirm the breed in future. German horse breeder, Verena Scholian, is one of the experts that have been working with the Azerbaijani government, advising them on breeding programs and technical equipment. Scholian, who has spent decades researching the Karabakh's blood-line, says it's easy to see the horses appeal. "I love handling them; they are calm, friendly and very sure footed," she said. Estimates on the number of Karabakh horses vary. According to the Karabakh Foundation, there are less than 1,000, but Scholian believes there could be less than 10 mares that are one-half pure bred. The mountain-steppe racing horse is named after the geographical region where it was originally developed. The Karabakh horse is the result of cross-breeding and stands out with what's been described as its "golden glow." The horses are also known for their exceptional speed. The Karabakh foundation says that in 2004, a horse from the Agdam region set a world record; running 1,000 meters in 1 minute and 9 seconds. The foundation's chair, Dr. Adil Baguirov, originally from the Karabakh region, says the horse has always been important to Azerbaijani's. "Azerbaijanis are Turkic people who until a few centuries ago enjoyed a semi-nomadic lifestyle, especially in the Karabakh region, which is lush with grass and has perfect pastures," he said. "Even as late as the 19th century, a sizable portion of Azerbaijanis, particularly in the Karabakh region, lived in mountains in the summer and in lowlands in the winter," he continued. Baguirov explains that it was the horses ability to handle mountainous and rugged terrain that deemed them an essential part of life. These days Scholian says the horses are mainly used for racing and as a status symbol for the rich. Guluzade currently has 35 pure bred Karabakh horses on his farm. He says he will continue to breed them because he is worried about their future. "My strategy for breeding was built on the premise that each pure bred mare should leave behind one offspring, preferably a mare," he said. "I will continue my work in this direction where others have been irresponsible in the past," he continued. The century-old breed is said to have incredible endurance and strength, qualities that Azerbaijani's hope will see the animals fight off extinction. "The Karabakh horses are a symbol of national heritage and pride. It's an ancient, national breed that is inseparable from our national identity," Rajabli said.

            <corpo>(CNN)In a still publicly unacknowledged incident, a Russian military surveillance aircraft flew close to four NATO warships in the Baltic Sea on Thursday, including the destroyer USS Jason Dunham, which captured video of the incident, a U.S. Defense Department official said Saturday. The Pentagon has not released the video. The Russian plane was a Russian Maritime Patrol aircraft, similar to the U.S. P8. The official said the Dunham was part of a four-ship group that also included British, French and German warships. At one point, the Russian aircraft flew above the deck of one of the NATO ships at an altitude of just 500 feet. RELATED: U.S., Russian aircraft came within 10 feet over Black Sea "We are not calling this safe and professional. We are calling it routine, but we are on the edge of being very uncomfortable," the official said. The official added that none of the warships felt directly threatened by the Russian overflight, but the flight was "lower and closer" than the U.S. had routinely seen. Since the last several recent encounters with Russian aircraft, the U.S. European Command is taking extra steps to ensure all ships and air crews are equipped with video gear.  </corpo>

            <descricao>How do doctors diagnose something they've never seen before? Through the online tool VisualDx -- a global database of diseases.
</descricao>
            <corpo>Vital Signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world. (CNN)How does a doctor diagnose something they've never seen before? One answer comes in the form of online tool VisualDx, a website and app used by medics to solve clinical conundrums -- in real-time. Doctors use the site by typing in the symptoms they see on their patients to bring up a list of possible causes and accompanying images. The more clues they type in, the more specific their options become. It's then a case of matching what they see on their screen to what they see on their patient to make an informed diagnosis. Diseases can also be looked up based on other factors including countries a patient has recently visited or activities they've done, such as camping, to bring up associated risks and diseases.  With more than 1,300 diseases on file -- and 1,500 more to be added by September 2015 -- it covers a wide range of medical conditions. "About 99.9% of all visits to clinicians are for under 500 diseases," says Dr. Art Papier, founder and CEO of VisualDx. "[But] there's a lot of error around common diseases," he says. According to the Society to Improve Diagnosis in Medicine, 5-15% of diagnoses are estimated to have errors. When a doctor makes a diagnosis, they're against the clock to sift through an array of potential diseases. "[Doctors] have to make fast-paced decisions," says Papier. The image-led nature of the app accommodates this pace. "You describe what you're seeing and that shows [image-based] diagnoses that include what you're seeing," says Dr. James Willig, an infectious disease specialist at UAB hospital in Alabama -- and VisualDx user. The ability to search and sift through a database of images in this way helps doctors like Willig diagnose faster and -- importantly -- more accurately. Having accessible information at their fingertips can also improve trust and rapport with patients.  The scenario today is more complex than ever before. Increased global travel and exposure to new infections means patients are often arriving at clinics with symptoms unseen by their doctors before. A prime example is the mosquito-borne Chikungunya, a debilitating infection originating in Asia which arrived in the Americas at the end of 2013 -- and continues to be transmitted today. "My colleague diagnosed the first case of Chikungunya in the state of Alabama," says Willig whose hospital has seen a number of Chikungunya cases. But this exposure to the unknown is nothing new as his hospital is a referral center for Alabama and its surrounding states. "We get just about everything," he says. With more than 150,000 images already available, VisualDx is helping clinicians like Willig readily identify what their patients are suffering from and particularly lends itself to skin-based symptoms such as rashes and ulcers, which are more visible. In April 2015, the tool helped Willig identify a rare form of vasculitis on a patient who repeatedly came to his hospital with a "bizarre periodic rash." Willig now uses the site several times a week.  The software aims to make it easier for frontline health workers -- the general practitioner -- who are expected to know it all. "In the past you read books and had to memorize it all," says Papier. "You can't memorize it all." The technology was launched in 1999, and more than 100 million images have been viewed to date. "Medicine is richly visual, and probably more so than most people appreciate," says Dr. Joshua Landy, creator of medical photo sharing app, Figure-1. "As clinicians, we use our eyes in assessing patients more frequently than we realize. Having clinical decision support in that same visual medium allows one to make a visual comparison side-by-side."  A large challenge facing clinicians is that people suffering from the same disease can manifest the condition differently, meaning their symptoms can look different -- particularly on different skin colors. "People present in different ways," says Dr. James Shoemaker, emergency physician at Elkhart General Hospital, Indiana -- who uses the app every day for more rapid diagnoses. "This has pictures of different skin colors," he says. When symptoms of a disease are mainly skin-based, the need to understand how they appear on different skin colors is crucial. The image collection and processing for VisualDx encompasses this and enables visual comparison of symptoms for example in Caucasians and Latino people. "There's no shift where you don't see something you've never seen before and it's nice to have that reinforcement," says Shoemaker.  According to VisualDX, more than 1,500 hospitals and clinics in the United States and more than half of the nation's medical schools use its product in their diagnostics, and it's also used in Europe and Asia. But Papier wants the program to broaden its horizons -- and diseases. "We want to bring this worldwide," he says. "[We want this to be] an ultimate diagnostic tool for any physician around the world."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>This was all about Putin, not the Pope - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Russian President visits Pope Francis, keeps Pontiff waiting for more than one hour.</descricao>
            <corpo>Moscow (CNN)There aren't many world leaders prepared to keep the Pope hanging around for a meeting. Russia's President is perhaps the only one. Pope Francis discovered this on Wednesday as he waited, patiently, for more than an hour at the Vatican for his guest to finally arrive. There aren't many world leaders either who could annex one part of a neighboring country while backing a bloody rebellion in another part, and still avoid strong criticism from, arguably, the world's most influential religious figure. Vladimir Putin appears to fall into that narrow category too. The issue of Ukraine was raised, we're told, during their brief, closed-door meeting. According to a Vatican statement, "The Holy Father affirmed that it is necessary to make a sincere and great effort to forge peace," in the war-ravaged country. Pope Francis and Putin also agreed to "restore a climate of dialogue." But the exchange was not the condemnation called for by many, including members of the Greek Catholic congregation, who number millions in Ukraine, and who have expressed frustration at the Pope's failure to criticize Russia's role in the Ukraine conflict. Nor are the words likely to satisfy the U.S. Ambassador to the Holy See, Kenneth Hackett, who urged the Vatican, ahead of the Putin meeting, to "say more about concerns on territorial integrity" in Ukraine. To be fair, the Vatican is not following the same diplomatic agenda as Western governments regarding Russia. The current Pope in particular has forged an unlikely strategic alliance with the former KGB officer-turned President that transcends the political tensions felt elsewhere with the Kremlin. The partnership seems to have begun in September 2013 when Pope Francis and Putin urged the U.S. to desist from taking military action in Syria -- a strong Kremlin ally. According to Christopher Hale, executive Director of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good, writing in Time Magazine, "Francis and Putin used two very different means to communicate their messages: Francis held a worldwide prayer vigil for peace, while Putin penned a somewhat audacious editorial in The New York Times in which he cited Pope Francis's objection as a reason for the U.S. to not get involved in the region." Hale goes on to suggest that Francis may play a diplomatic role in resolving the conflict in Ukraine too. But if Wednesday's meeting was anything to go on, in which the Pontiff and the President exchanged gifts, I wouldn't get your hopes up. No, that meeting was more about Putin than the Pope. Just a day after being publicly scolded by the world's industrial powers, the G7 -- including a particularly strong rebuke from U.S. President Barack Obama -- Putin was shoulder to shoulder with the spiritual leader of 1 billion Roman Catholics worldwide. Russia may not be quite so isolated after all.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Le Bourget Paris Air Show 2015: What to watch for - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Drones, remote tech and aircraft cabins of the future on the agenda at major aviation industry event</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)As the world's oldest and largest air show, the Paris Air Show is the undisputed queen of its kind. The tarmac of Paris-Le Bourget Airport is set, once again, to be heaving with manufacturers, military representatives, businessmen and the general public from across the globe. So what will the 51st edition of the biannual spectacle, which runs June 15-21, have in store? Here are five key trends I believe are likely to take center stage.  The link between air connectivity and global economic growth is profound, so it's no surprise to see the emerging economies of the world -- and those with fast growing middle classes -- experiencing the highest demand for aircraft and aerospace infrastructure. Asia is booming. The region is expected to represent two thirds of global aviation sector growth by 2034, so observers expect a flurry of orders from its airlines at Le Bourget. While such rapid regional growth is sensational to watch from the sidelines, there are a number of practical considerations for those supporting larger fleets of aircraft. Although the bulk of orders are coming from newer Asian markets, the infrastructure to support them is still mainly in Europe and North America. Maintenance, repair and overhaul support cannot operate effectively from a distance, particularly for short-haul aircraft that dominate the market by volume -- it has to be local. The development of regional hub networks is a crucial factor for expansion into these highly profitable regions, opening up opportunities to new players in the market. Maintenance of aircraft is one thing, but planes also have to be able to take off and land somewhere. The rapid population growth across Asian countries far surpasses the speed of the airport infrastructure development required to support it. In fact, the number of airports per million people in Asia represents a fraction of 1% -- far lower than in the West. Airport development and access to airports has to match and keep pace with population growth -- this is a much greater restriction on the region's development than the availability of aircraft. The logistics of this, and the need to provide sufficient airport infrastructure across the region, will be a major discussion point.  The Internet of Things isn't a new concept for the aviation industry. Sensors and digital automation have been common features within manufacturing and the operation of machinery for more than a decade. In recent years the surge of new and powerful technologies has opened commercial possibilities for aerospace and defense companies. One area evolving rapidly is technology that enables engineers to check on the performance of every mechanical component on board a plane. In the wake of the last year's spate of aircraft losses, renewed focus has been placed in this area. However, there's more work to be done before real time health monitoring from the skies becomes commonplace. I expect to see a plethora of companies working to push us closer toward comprehensive inflight monitoring and direct communication between aircraft sensors and operations on the ground. Within the next five years or so, I'd expect significantly more ground staff to have access to a constant stream of information, giving them continual and complete understanding of an aircraft's performance. What could this mean for the future? Were an engine to develop issues midair, could it be possible for a standby system to kick in and run crucial systems from the ground, enabling the flight to continue safely? The security and legal ramifications of remote operation are yet to be ironed out, and there are ongoing issues with bandwidth, but this is the direction the industry is moving. We'll likely see major technological developments from players at the cutting edge of this market at Le Bourget this year.  The mobile revolution has put a smart device in the hands of almost every airline passenger -- we expect to be online at all times. But only a fraction of air passengers can access the Internet. There's a huge drive to change this as airlines battle for "connected customers." Plans to roll out further "connected routes," especially on long haul flights, will certainly be on the agenda in Paris. I predict innovations around increasing bandwidth and in security -- an area that developers will be keen to address, as inflight connectivity invariably opens the door for potential hackers. Developments don't stop here. The notion of the connected flier brings with it a new technological trend: the integration of connected devices with the aircraft itself. This could be through phone or tablet apps that allow passengers to order food and drink, control inflight entertainment and adjust the lighting around their seat.  Aerospace interiors is a huge, exciting and innovative marketplace. Companies big and small are drawing inspiration from other areas, such as the automotive industry, to tackle a whole range of pain point issues in the aircraft cabin. We'll see a glimpse into the future of the cabin experience, as companies showcase solutions to issues of privacy and personal space, seat density, weight reduction and cabin ambiance. Airlines are under increased pressure to drive down cost and boost capacity while improving their share of the lucrative first- and business-class passenger groups. The trend for the likes of the Gulf carriers to adopt more advanced and luxurious options for upmarket passengers is set to continue. At the other end of the spectrum, ongoing demand for low-cost air travel will focus airlines on the clever use of space and weight distribution to accommodate extra seating. Between these two polar extremes of consumer travel, there's a growing trend toward using aircraft interiors to develop more intermediate classes. There's talk of the traditional three (first, business, economy) being expanded to five with the addition of two more premium economy options. Proposals for these will likely be on display at the Paris Air Show.  Drones and Unmanned Air Systems will continue to be a huge area -- the UAS market is possibly the fastest growing area in the aerospace and defense industries. What's so astonishing about this area is the breadth of its influence. In recent years the market has expanded from monitoring and bombing activity in war zones, to disaster relief efforts (most recently in the wake of the earthquake in Nepal), aircraft inspection for maintenance and the delivery of parcels. The technology, which will be on display in abundance at Le Bourget, is already mature, so the discussion is likely to focus on challenges surrounding its application, for example airspace access. The perceived lack of control and subsequent security issues in this domain have been demonstrated by recent near misses between drones and commercial aircraft, particularly in and around airports.

            <descricao>A French court acquits Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund, of charges of aggravated pimping.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN) A court in France acquitted Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the International Monetary Fund, on Friday of charges of aggravated pimping. Strauss-Kahn, 66, once thought to be a top contender for the French presidency, had been accused in connection with sex parties he attended in various cities across the world. The judge said Friday that Strauss-Kahn, commonly referred to as DSK, didn't deny his participation in the sex parties but said he did not know the women were prostitutes. The judge agreed that the status of the women was not clear, giving a long list of other people who claimed not to know they were prostitutes.  Strauss-Kahn, who calls himself a libertine, never recruited or paid the women, the judge said. And an analysis of Strauss-Kahn's text messages did not allow the court to consider him to have been the instigator of the sex parties, the judge said, adding that therefore, Strauss-Kahn did not commit any unlawful acts. In France, prostitution is legal, but pimping is not. The Strauss-Kahn verdict was not a surprise. Even the prosecutor in Lille, in northern France, had said previously that there was insufficient evidence to convict the former presidential hopeful. But investigative magistrates had pursued the case nevertheless.  Prosecutors also alleged that two other defendants, businessman David Roquet and Fabrice Paszkowski, a businessman friend of Strauss-Kahn, picked up the bills for the sex parties, which took place in places such as Belgium, New York and Washington and were arranged to fit Strauss-Kahn's schedule. Both were acquitted. In fact, the verdicts were a broad defeat for those who had pursued criminal charges. Of the 14 defendants, only one was found guilty of a criminal offense: René Kojfer, the head of public relations at the Lille Carlton hotel, was given a one-year suspended jail sentence for aiding the prostitution of various women and acting as an intermediary between prostitutes and clients. But politically, the case was an enormous setback for Strauss-Kahn. In graphic testimony, some of the women involved accused him of sexual brutality. And the picture painted -- with parties, nudity, and group sex -- was a departure from the staid mistresses that were kept by some former prominent French politicians and generally accepted by the public. Strauss-Kahn was once considered the leading contender to run against Nicolas Sarkozy for the presidency of France. But in 2011, a maid at a New York hotel accused him of sexual assault. Strauss-Kahn was initially charged with attempted rape and imprisonment in that case, but the charges were dropped after his accuser admitted lying about some details. The following year, Strauss-Kahn and the maid, Nafissatou Diallo, reached a settlement in a suit she had filed against him. The terms of the settlement were not disclosed.  </corpo>

            <descricao>On June 12th, Azerbaijan brings up the curtain on the first-ever European Games when its capital, Baku, will welcome some 6,000 athletes.</descricao>
            <corpo>CNN's On the Road series brings you a greater insight into countries around the world. This time we travel to Azerbaijan in the lead up to the European Games to explore the culture of sports in the country sitting on the Caspian Sea. (CNN)This month marks the start of a new era: on June 12th, Azerbaijan brings up the curtain on the first-ever European Games when its capital, Baku, will welcome some 6,000 athletes to this inaugural sporting festival. The Games, which will take place every four years, were brought into being at a vote by members of the European Olympic Committee (EOC) in 2012 and announced at a meeting of the body's General Assembly in Rome that December. Thirty-eight of the 49 EOC members backed the Games, which provide a European equivalent of the multi-sport Asian Games and the Pan-American Games, both of which have been part of the calendar since 1951. Representatives of 50 European nations will compete, with the opening ceremony taking place on Friday June 12th and the closing ceremony being held on Sunday 28th. The committee said the event "is in no way intended to be a copy of the Olympic Games" and is "a tool with which to enhance the attractiveness of sport." Which sports are being showcased? The new Games will play host to some new disciplines after the Olympic Committee made its selection from an "overwhelming" number of suggestions. Twenty sports will be on the agenda -- 16 Olympic events and the other four making their debuts in this format. First, the familiar ones: aquatics, archery, athletics, badminton, judo, volleyball, boxing, canoe, cycling, fencing, gymnastics, shooting, table tennis, taekwondo, triathlon and wrestling will all be there. And what of the newcomers? Well, they're 3x3 basketball, karate, beach soccer and sambo. The first three are self-explanatory -- but what exactly is sambo? And how do you do it? Sambo has its roots in the military history of the Soviet Union, of which Azerbaijan was a part. A martial art, it was devised as an element of Red Army training in the 1920s with the intention of sharpening soldiers' hand-to-hand combat skills. Throwing, groundwork and submissions are all elements -- the sport has echoes of both wrestling and judo, but rules and restrictions are different -- and the name is a truncated version of the Russian for 'self-defence without weapons.' We can probably expect Russia to do well in this one. What are the incentives for athletes? They are twofold: both the winning of medals for their country and opportunities to qualify for the 2016 Rio Olympics. Baku will host 253 medal events, with direct Olympic qualification at stake in disciplines including the triathlon. What do we know about Baku? We know there had been initial thoughts that Russia and Turkey would be in contention to be host nation -- but Azerbaijan was the only bidder, and Baku, with a population of around 2.5 million, takes its place in the spotlight. The city, the largest in the South Caucasus and the biggest on the shores of the Caspian Sea, mixes the influences of east and west and, at the heart of an oil-rich nation, has plenty of conspicuous wealth: there are gleaming office towers and the boulevards at its center are home to high-end shops. Look beyond the shininess, though, and you'll find the true heart of the place -- the walled Old City, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, has its origins in the 12th century, while lush green promenades wind around the coastline. What does Azerbaijan hope to gain from hosting the Games? Azerbaijan wants to put itself and its capital at center stage, with sports minister Azad Rahimov saying in an interview with The Guardian newspaper: "The main important thing is to position our country on the map of the world and our country on the map of Europe. "The best instrument to do that is sport and culture. Sport has a bigger potential for reaching the most people." The Netherlands is set to host the second European Games, which will take place in 2019.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Imagine a city where the waters rise, eight people are killed, and wild animals roam the streets. That was the case in Tblisi, the capital of Georgia.
</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Wild animals roamed the streets of Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, on Sunday, after raging floodwaters damaged the city's zoo and set many of the animals free. Eight people were killed by the flooding, several others were missing, and wolves, bears, big cats and even a hippopotamus were wandering the streets of the city, according to Civil.ge, a news agency funded by the EU and the UN.  Of the zoo's 600 residents, including fish and birds, about half were missing on Sunday, theTbilisi Zoo said. Some animals have been recaptured, Civil.ge reported. Others have been killed. But some animals were still on the lam. Video from the city shows what appears to be a crocodile slithering down the city streets, as well as a hippopotamus standing around looking confused. Also among the escapees were lions, tigers, bears and wolves, the agency reported. Georgia's Prime Minister Irakli Garibashvili asked residents to stay home while the animals are rounded up. The Ministry of Internal Affairs also urged everyone to stay indoors but said in a statement that the situation was "under full control." All efforts are being made to find the animals quickly, "give them injections," and get them back into the zoo, the ministry said. Two employees of the zoo were among the fatalities.  The problems began before midnight Saturday. Heavy rainfall turned the Vere River, normally little more than a stream through the center of Tbilisi, into a torrent, the news agency reported. The raging river flooded significant portions of a highway, swept away cars and at least one small house, and flooded many other homes. Images on Tbilisi City Hall's Facebook page showed roads washed out, hillsides collapsed and vehicles tossed about like toys. Rescue workers carried people on their shoulders through waist-high water. Police used a helicopter to evacuate 16 people from Akhaldaba, just west of Tbilisi, where heavy rain had damaged roads.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>How high-tech clothes could be your next doctor - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>To find out about your body's vital signs, all you need to do is to get dressed, with smart fabrics letting you monitor your health with your clothes. </descricao>
            <corpo>Vital Signs is a monthly program bringing viewers health stories from around the world (CNN)To find out all you need to know about your body's vital signs, all you need to do is to get dressed. The burgeoning market for intelligent clothing that can measure stats including your heart and respiratory rate has resulted in a broad range of wearables which could one-day act simultaneously as an on-call doctor. "[People] can be monitored 24/7 and not have to be in hospital to do it," says Bennet Fisher, of CircuiteX, the smart fabrics arm of Noble Biomaterials. "The data collected ... can provide a general profile of a person's health."  The technology is based on the use of conductive yarns -- most commonly made with silver -- which are woven into fabrics to act as sensors that detect electrical signals, acting as electrocardiograms (ECGs) and electromyograms (EMGs) to measure heart rate and muscle activity respectively. The silver can either be woven in throughout a piece of clothing or else through tapes or patches sewn into specific regions. "You can put it in any close-fitting garment," says Andy Baker, CEO of SmartLife, whose t-shirts and sports bra are set to launch in September 2015. The closer the sensor to the skin, the better the signal detected. Read this: Contact lens with a built-in telescope Signals are then transmitted to detectors -- in the form of apps on a smartphone or tablet -- easily carried by the wearer. The information collected can also be uploaded to the cloud or sent to a third party, such as a doctor. Baker thinks this line of clothing could revolutionize medical practices. "We could put a t-shirt on 20 people in a ward and a clinician can walk in with an i-Pad and see all 20 heart rates," says Baker. The rules of medical approval mean such an application is still a few years away, but Smartlife is targeting medical use by 2017. "We don't want to diagnose, just collect and share the data as they wish," adds Baker.  The most prominent types of clothing in development were originally intended to monitor athletes as part of their training, but are now set to benefit the health of the general public. T-shirts, sports bras and shorts are currently being trialed by companies such as CircuiteX, SmartLife and Finland-based Clothing+. "If you become ill, in the hospital the doctor will first do some tests like take your pulse, blood pressure and temperature," says Mikko Malmivaara, head of marketing at Clothing+. This baseline information is crucial for doctors to get a snapshot of their patient's state of health. But longer-term data could be even more valuable as a comparison. "If the doctor had access to the patient's biodata from a longer period back, they could make a far better diagnosis, seeing trends in the data," adds Malmivaara. The close-fitting nature of sports shirts and bras makes them a popular choice among those developing the technology, with CircuiteX counting Victoria's Secret and Adidas among its clients now opting to enable their customers to track their vital signs. SmartLife and Clothing+ are also developing health vests to be worn under normal clothing either throughout the day or at crucial times of day -- such as during people's morning routine. The tomography vest developed by Clothing+ is aimed at cardiac patients. "During their normal routines ... the vest scans the lungs for fluid and ... can detect a weakening heart up to 10 days prior to a collapse," claims Malmivaara, who says that one of the symptoms of a failing heart is fluid accumulating in the lungs. Read this: The worms that invade your brain  The versatility of smart fabrics has enabled their use to extend beyond everyday apparel to clothing such as edema socks and materials such as smart bandages. The data collected also extends beyond heart rates to more specific indicators such as inflammation and pressure. Socks designed by Danish company Ohmatex monitor edema -- fluid retention commonly in the feet and legs -- by electronically measuring the circumference of the wearer's leg. The presence of fluid is an early warning sign of heart failure or pre-eclampsia. "Patients can be [made] aware of increased swelling," says Christian Dalsgaard, chief technical officer at Ohmatex. "Edema is not well understood but is an indicator something is wrong," he says. Next on the agenda for SmartLife are compression bandages that use two-way signals in and out of the fabric to track how far a bandage is being stretched, as well as the pressure it's putting on the wearer. This should help medical professionals to apply bandages securely and with more accuracy, in addition to then monitoring any movement in the wearer once fitted. "[Wounds] only heal if they have the correct pressure," says Baker.  Ohmatex is not prioritizing everyday wearers but instead dedicated professions, ranging from firefighters to astronauts. Among its earlier innovations was the use of temperature sensors in fire suits to prevent firefighters overheating whilst in action, which have now been trialled in U.S. firefighter academies. "Heat stress can make a firefighter collapse due to dehydration and temperature shock," says Dalsgaard. Three signals are collected to monitor the temperature outside of a fire suit and heat levels close to the skin, with alarms then signaling when to leave. Currently in development -- in association with the European Space Agency (ESA) -- is smart clothing for astronauts to monitor muscle activity and wasting whilst in zero gravity. Astronauts need to exercise regularly when in space to prevent their muscles from wasting, as no forces are acting on them to keep them in shape. "If you don't [exercise] your muscles will decrease within 20 to 30 days and you won't walk when you return," says Dalsgaard. Data that gives a clear indication of an astronaut's muscle development could help to personalize their training regime. Dalsgaard hopes his new line of space clothing will be on the catwalks of the International Space Station in 2017.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Germanwings Flight 9525 co-pilot Andreas Lubitz feared he was going blind and went to see dozens of doctors before he crashed a plane into the French Alps.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Before he plunged a plane into the French Alps, Germanwings Flight 9525 co-pilot Andreas Lubitz feared he was going blind and went to see dozens of doctors, a French prosecutor said Thursday. In the month leading up to the crash, Lubitz consulted doctors seven times, including one visit to a generalist, three visits to a psychiatrist and three visits to a nose, ear and throat specialist, Marseille prosecutor Brice Robin told reporters. The statements by the prosecutor provide new details about the medical and psychological problems that investigators have long suggested were likely Lubitz's motive for crashing the commercial jet. Lubitz, 27, told one of his doctors that he had consulted numerous eye doctors and numerous neurologists, Robin said. And during the five years leading up to the crash, he consulted a total of 41 physicians, Robin said. Lubitz, according to the prosecutor, feared he was losing his sight and suffered from severe depression involving "psychosis accompanied by vision problems," according to CNN affiliate BFMTV. He indicated to those who were close to him that "life no longer had any meaning considering the loss of his eyesight," Robin said. And he had complained to doctors that he saw only "30 to 35 percent of objects in dark," saw light flashes and couldn't sleep because of his vision problems, according to the prosecutor. In March, a European government official who'd been briefed on the investigation told CNN that after Lubitz complained about vision problems, an eye doctor diagnosed him with a psychosomatic disorder and gave him an "unfit for work" note. German police searching Lubitz's apartment after the crash found prescription drugs to treat depression and anxiety. Robin said he has ordered toxicology tests on the co-pilot's remains and is still awaiting results. Robin announced Thursday that France is opening a criminal inquiry into the March 24 crash, which killed all 150 people aboard the plane. That opens up the possibility that others could face prosecution, even though investigators believe it was Lubitz who deliberately took down the plane. Key questions remain unanswered: How much did the airline know about Lubitz's health issues, how much should they have known and was there any way the crash could have been prevented? A Germanwings spokesman told CNN that the airline can't comment on the prosecutor's findings, as Lubitz's medical details are "subject to medical confidentiality." CNN's Lucy Pawle contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <descricao>It's a variation on the informal street basketball played all over the world -- and now 3x3 is one of the star attractions at the first-ever European Games.</descricao>
            <corpo>CNN's On the Road series brings you a greater insight into countries around the world. This time we travel to Azerbaijan in the lead up to the European Games to explore the culture of sports in the country sitting on the Caspian Sea. (CNN)It's a variation on the sort of informal street basketball played all over the world -- and now 3x3 is one of the star attractions at the first-ever European Games in Baku, Azerbaijan. But what, exactly, does the game involve? As its name suggests, it's a pared-down version of the traditional five-a-side version, needing just three players on each team. That pared-down nature extends to the playing space, half the size of the court required for a full game and using only one hoop rather than two. The popularity of 3x3 has rocketed since the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) chose it as an alternative form of the game to be played at the 2010 Youth Olympics in Singapore.  Its large-scale roots, though, go back further than that: American organization Hoop It Up organized a major competition back in 1989, while similar events were held in the U.S. during the early 1990s. After making the decision to promote 3x3 for Singapore, officials worked on the compilation of a set of rules that could be applied just as well in international competition as they could in pickup street games. The result is a sport that just won't stop growing -- FIBA estimates that around 250 million people around the world enjoy 3x3, with more and more continuing to join a sprawling network of organizers, leagues and players. Azerbaijani athlete Amil Hamzayev, whose achievements in 3x3 include winning the FIBA European Championship for Small Countries twice, is one of those players. The 24-year old tells the official Baku 2015 website that one of the biggest challenges of playing 3x3 is the effect of weather conditions -- a hazard unknown, of course, to players of the indoor game. "I'm excited to represent my country in front of our national crowd," Hamzayev -- who names American legend Michael Jordan as his favorite basketball star -- says.  A word or two about those 3x3 rules: they're nice and easy. Baskets scored from inside the arc bring a point, while those scored from outside bring two. Games are played over a single period of 10 minutes and won by the first team to score 21 points or the team with the highest score at the end of the 10 minutes. If the scores are tied at the end of the 10 minutes, overtime is played and the winner of the game is the first team to score two points. And that's the only thing about 3x3 that doesn't appeal to Hamzayev. He would rather see the victors needing three, necessitating more than one basket -- but he admits he would have been all at sea without basketball. "I would probably have finished naval college and become a ship's captain by now," he says.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Race of Rachel Dolezal, Spokane NAACP head, questioned - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>The racial identity of Rachel Dolezal, a prominent face in Spokane's black community, is under question; her parents say she's white, being "deceptive." </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The race of one of the most prominent faces in Spokane, Washington's black community is under question after her estranged mother claimed she is white but is "being dishonest and deceptive with her identity." Rachel Dolezal, 37, is the head of the local chapter of the NAACP and has identified herself as at least partly African-American. But her Montana birth certificate says she was born to two parents who say they are Caucasian. The parents shared that document and old photos with CNN. "We are her birth parents," Lawrence Dolezal told CNN on Friday. "We do not understand why she feels it's necessary to misrepresent her ethnicity." CNN tried to reach Rachel Dolezal for comment by emailing and calling her, but was unsuccessful. The Spokane Spokesman-Review. newspaper reported, though, that she has framed the controversy surrounding her racial identity in the context of litigation over guardianship of her adopted brother. According to court documents obtained by CNN, Rachel Dolezal's adopted brother, who is black, sought emancipation from Ruthanne and Lawrence Dolezal in 2010. The adopted brother, now 21, said the Dolezals used "physical forms of punishment" and had sent his brother and sister away to group homes because they didn't cooperate with the couple's religion and rules. The adopted brother wanted to live with Rachel Dolezal "in a multiracial household where black culture is celebrated and I have a connection to the black community," the court papers said. The papers did not specify Rachel Dolezal's race. The petition for emancipation was dropped. In a separate legal action in 2010, the court appointed Rachel Dolezal to be the adopted brother's guardian with the consent of Ruthanne and Lawrence Dolezal. On Friday, the Dolezals told CNN they didn't want to comment on a possible "legal dispute" their daughter or the NAACP had mentioned. One organization that appears to be standing behind her is the NAACP. The group, historically one of the most prominent in supporting causes important to the African-American community, said Friday that Dolezal is "enduring a legal issue with her family" and that "we respect her privacy in this matter." "One's racial identity is not a qualifying criteria or disqualifying standard for NAACP leadership," the group said. "The NAACP Alaska-Oregon-Washington State Conference stands behind Ms. Dolezal's advocacy record."  Dolezal represented herself as African-American -- along with several other ethnicities, including white and Native American -- in an application for a Spokane police ombudsman commission. And she has presented the public with a different family photograph posted to the local NAACP chapter's Facebook page. When she announced her father was coming to town for a visit, she showed herself standing next to an older African-American man. Dolezal's public racial identity came under scrutiny on Thursday, when a reporter from CNN affiliate KXLY held up that photo asked her if it showed her dad. She replied that it did. Then came a follow-up question: "Are you African-American?" "I don't understand the question of -- I did tell you that, yes, that's my dad. And he was unable to come in January," Dolezal responded. "Are your parents -- are they white?" came the next query. Dolezal walked away from the microphone, leaving her purse and keys, and took refuge in a nearby clothing boutique.  Dolezal has built a wide-ranging career as an expert on and advocate for the black community. She is not just president of her local NAACP chapter; she is also an academic expert on African-American culture and teaches many related classes at Eastern Washington University. She represents the black community publicly and vocally, including as a spokeswoman on race-influenced police violence. On Tuesday she spoke to Al Jazeera on the topic. And Dolezal has appeared alongside Baltimore City State's Attorney Marilyn Mosby, who has filed charges against police officers in the death of Freddie Gray, a young black man. The mayor of Spokane appointed Dolezal chairwoman of a police oversight committee to keep an eye on fairness in police work. After the allegations of faked racial identity surfaced, Mayor David Condon and City Council President Ben Stuckart said they take "very seriously the concerns raised regarding the chair of the independent citizen police ombudsman commission." The city is checking to see if she has violated any policies. Still, what Dolezal has done is more important than what race she is to the NAACP, regional President Gerald Hankerson said. He called the NAACP a civil rights organization first that includes "leaders from all different ethnicities," adding that it "doesn't do a genealogy search on what a person's ethnicity is when they" take a top position. As to Dolezal specifically, Hankerson said, "We represent all civil rights issues, regardless of a person's ethnicity. And the quality of the work that she has done to elevate the issues of civil rights in that region is what we applaud." Dolezal has said she's been harassed in Spokane because of her race and activism. In September 2009, she told Spokane police she found a noose on her front porch a few days after her house was burglarized, according to a police report. Dolezal said she had numerous problems with the Aryan Nation and other hate groups because of her job and "biracial heritage," the report said. "I spent a lot of time in Mississippi so when I saw that rope, I knew what it was," she said in an article in the Coueur d'Alene Press. In February she reported finding an unnerving letter in the post office box for the NAACP. The police report said the envelope contained copies of news articles, prints of old photos of lynching victims and quotes about socialism and the New World Order. The letter contained no direct threats against Dolezal or the NAACP, police said. Police haven't made arrests in either of the cases.  Rachel Dolezal grew up in what her parents called a diverse family, with friends from various ethnicities and four adopted siblings who were black. She was "always interested in ethnicity and diversity" growing up, her mother Ruthanne Dolezal said. Dolezal attended college in Mississippi, then went on to Howard University on scholarship -- not having identified herself black then on her application, because there was no such option, though people there may have assumed as much "because her portfolio of art was all African-American portraiture," her mother said. It wasn't until around 2007, her parents said, that Dolezal began identifying herself more with the African-American community, according to her mother. Her parents say Rachel Dolezal "has chosen to distance herself from the family." "She has not explained to us why she is doing what she is doing and being dishonest ... with her identity," Ruthanne Dolezal said. Rachel Dolezal wouldn't answer the Spokesman-Review's questions about her racial heritage directly and said she wanted to talk to local NAACP leadership first. "I feel like I owe my executive committee a conversation," she said. "That question is not as easy as it seems," Dolezal told the Spokesman-Review. "There's a lot of complexities ... and I don't know that everyone would understand that." The NAACP, it seems, wasn't about to disqualify her if she's indeed white. "In every corner of this country," the group said, "the NAACP remains committed to securing political, educational and economic justice for all people. And we encourage Americans of all stripes to become members and serve as leaders in our organization."  The story riled up many on social media, with Dolezal's name and the term "transracial" becoming top trending hashtags on Twitter. Some users raised the idea of racial passing, in which a person of one race acts as if they belong to another. Others floated the notion that people could cross over lines of racial identity as they do with sexual identity. "Hmm interesting article about #racheldolezal. If she identifies as black, can she be transracial?" one user asked. Other users compared Dolezal with Caitlyn Jenner, formerly known as Bruce Jenner, often in a derogatory manner. But many users, particularly African-Americans, bemoaned that switching race doesn't work like switching gender, noting that black people can't pretend to be white to avoid discrimination. "My prob w/ #Transracial: Black folk cant decide to be white when the cops raid their pool party. But a white woman can be NAACP president," wrote hip-hop artist Lizzo. "If #RachelDolezal can do it, so can I. I am now a white American. Give me: good credit, the ability to swim, and police NOT beating me," PrestonMitchum tweeted. "It's not just her appropriation. It's that she claimed an oppression that wasn't hers," wrote user Charles Clymer. Yet Hankerson -- the top NAACP official for Washington state as well as Oregon and Alaska -- questioned how much her race should really matter and whether this debate was worth having. "It's unfortunate that this has become a trending conversation," he said, "when there's a lot more important things that are going on in America that we should be better addressing." CNN's Tony Marco and Ralph Ellis contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)When his father gave him a box of old home movies, Steven Smirco popped a tape in his VCR and sat down to relive his childhood. There, amid the birthday parties, communions and family Christmases, he was surprised to find something else: footage of President John F. Kennedy, youthful in a "Mad Men"-era suit, shaking hands with well-wishers on a damp, overcast day. "I was not aware of it," said Smirco of the grainy clip, filmed by his dad, Edwin Lee Smirco, on an 8 mm camera. Few people were. In fact, outside a handful of friends and relatives nobody had seen the footage, filmed during Kennedy's June 2, 1961, visit to Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, or SHAPE, the base of NATO's Allied Command Operations outside Paris. At the time, the elder Smirco was serving in the U.S. Army and stationed at SHAPE. He was off duty on the morning Kennedy visited, so he grabbed his movie camera and joined the throngs waiting to catch a glimpse of the President. Kennedy, barely four months into his presidency, arrived in a black sedan with flags mounted on its hood. He gave a brief speech about how the United States was "joined with you in the common defense of freedom of this historic section of the world," then retreated to a cafeteria for breakfast. Opinion: What JFK learned -- and taught-- about leadership A short time later, Kennedy emerged and began working the crowd as he moved toward his car. Smirco, who had filmed Kennedy's arrival, picked up his camera again as the President drew near. "He came up and was shaking people's hands," Edwin Smirco said. "I had to release one of my hands from the camera to shake his hand." Moments later, Kennedy departed. But he left Smirco with an indelible memory -- and one minute and 43 seconds of film to prove it. "Me and the President? It was unbelievable," he said. "That was quite a day. Yes it was." Despite his excitement, Smirco didn't tell many people about his brush with JFK. To this day, the retired Defense Department employee, 79, remains secretive about his reasons for being at SHAPE -- it was at the height of the Cold War, after all -- and wary of publicity. JFK assassination changed Secret Service About a decade ago, Smirco transferred his home movies to VHS tapes and gave them to his four children. Oldest child Steven Smirco discovered the JFK footage shortly afterward but didn't try to make it public until recently, when his girlfriend suggested people might want to see it. "It's a home movie. It's been sitting in a closet. It didn't really cross my mind that it would be of interest," said the younger Smirco, 57, of Fredericksburg, Virginia. "I don't know why we held onto it for so long without trying to make it available." In recent months he had the tapes digitized and reached out to several media outlets, including CNN, about airing the footage. CNN shared Smirco's film with archivists at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston, who verified its authenticity. Granted, the footage doesn't capture a particularly momentous or intimate moment in JFK's life. The brief SHAPE visit was part of weeklong trip to Europe -- Kennedy's first as president -- that included meetings with world leaders in Paris, Vienna and London. It wasn't as noteworthy as his return trip in 1963, with its "Ich bin ein Berliner" speech in the shadow of the Berlin Wall. Still, Steven Smirco is proud of his father's small contribution to the JFK legacy. "People still have a lot of interest in Kennedy," he said. "It's great that something like this can be shown to the world." 5 things you might not know about JFK's assassination  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Opinion: A key to America's power - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>The U.S. is one of the few developed countries that is projected to avoid demographic decline, partly as a result of immigration.</descricao>
            <corpo>Joseph S. Nye Jr. is a professor at Harvard University and the author of "Is the American Century Over?" The views expressed are his own. (CNN)As the 2016 presidential campaign heats up, candidates inevitably jockey for position on the contentious issue of immigration. The problem is that most focus on short-term issues and fail to take a longer historical view of the effect immigration has on America as a world power. Because if they did, they would see that at a time when declinists are again proclaiming the end of the American century, immigration is one of the bright spots about our position. Population alone does not determine national power, but it is an important component, particularly if those human resources are educated and assimilated. It is encouraging, therefore, that the United States is one of the few developed countries that is projected to avoid demographic decline and keep its share of world population, partly as a result of immigration. Most developed countries can expect to experience a shortage of people as this century progresses, whereas the U.S. Census Bureau projects that between 2010 and 2050, the American population will grow by 42%, to 439 million. According to U.N. demographers, today's top-ranking states in terms of population are China, India and the United States. By 2050, they project the order will be India, China and the United States. Because of its one-child policy in the past century, China's population will age and actually shrink. As many Chinese say, they fear that their country will "become old before we become rich." So, 50 years from now, the United States will probably remain one of the top three or four most populous countries, with an age distribution that will be younger than that of other developed countries. Not only is this relevant to economic power, but given the fact that nearly all developed countries are aging and face a burden of providing for the older generation, immigration can help reduce the sharpness of our policy problem. We should particularly encourage the education of young immigrants. Studies show that as immigrant college graduates increase, so does the increase in patents per capita. A quarter of high-tech start-ups have an immigrant founder, while 40% of Fortune 500 companies were founded by immigrants or their children. And immigration also benefits America's soft, or attractive, power. The fact that people want to come to the United States enhances American appeal, and the upward mobility of immigrants is attractive to people in other countries. America is a magnet, and many people can envisage themselves as Americans. Many Americans "look like" citizens of other countries. Moreover, connections between immigrants and their families and friends back home help to convey accurate and positive information about the United States. Rather than diluting hard and soft power, immigration enhances both. Of course, many worry about the impact that these arrivals will have on the makeup of U.S. society. But the reality is that popular fears about assimilation and the effect of immigration on a coherent sense of American identity are nothing new. The 19th-century "Know-Nothing" Party was built upon opposition to immigrants, particularly the Irish. A century later, the country elected an Irish Catholic president. The U.S. remains a nation of immigrants with a creed of opportunity for newcomers. During the 20th century, America recorded its highest percentage of foreign-born residents in 1910 -- 14.7% of the population. A century later, about 40 million people, or nearly 13% of Americans today, are foreign-born citizens. Yet despite this being a nation of immigrants, a recent Pew poll showed that 36% of Americans want legal immigration decreased. Why? It appears that both the numbers and origins of the new immigrants have caused concerns about immigration's impact on American culture. Data from the 2010 census showed a soaring Hispanic population, and at 16% of the total population, Hispanics have replaced African-Americans as the nation's largest minority. But while critics fear they will not assimilate, most of the evidence suggests that the latest immigrants are assimilating at least as quickly as their predecessors. A few years before his recent death, I asked Lee Kuan Yew, the former Prime Minister of Singapore and an astute observer of both the United States and China, whether he thought China would overtake the United States as the leading power of the 21st century. He said "no," because the United States is able to re-create itself by attracting the best and brightest from the rest of the world and melding them into a diverse culture of creativity. China has 1.3 billion people to recruit from domestically, but in his view, its Sino-centric culture makes it less creative than the United States, which can draw upon a talent pool of more than 7 billion people. That is, as long as we remember that we are indeed a nation of immigrants. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. Read CNNOpinion's Flipboard magazine.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Whether you decide to sleep with other people, the true definition of an open marriage has nothing to do with sex.  </descricao>
            <corpo>Mel Robbins is a CNN commentator, legal analyst, best-selling author and keynote speaker. In 2014, she was named outstanding news talk-radio host by the Gracie Awards. Follow her @melrobbins. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)I remember our wedding like it was yesterday. My father and I started walking down the aisle in the front yard at my childhood home, and Chris shot me the widest smile I'd ever seen. Everyone else disappeared in that moment. That was almost 20 years ago. Our marriage has been more fulfilling than I could have ever imagined. Yet after two decades, who wouldn't be intrigued by the thought of having sex with someone new? A new dating website, Open Minded, is creating buzz because it's designed not for cheaters but for people who want open relationships. According to its founder, women and men are increasingly seeking romantic partners outside their marriage and want to be open about it. A few years ago, my husband and I thought about having an open marriage. Chris and I met in 1994, got engaged immediately and married in 1996. Like all relationships, ours has been adventurous for sure; one that's taken us through multiple career changes, graduate schools, several moves, starting a family, building a community of friends and losing too many loved ones to cancer, suicide and time. There is nothing more exciting than the first few weeks or months of a relationship. Your neurotransmitters are firing on all cylinders, the mere thought of the person can send a surge of dopamine through your body and even just going to the grocery store together is the hottest date imaginable. It's the strongest drug on the planet. But the real question isn't "would you want" to have sex with people outside your marriage - it's "could you handle it?" Two summers ago, that is precisely what Chris and I explored. It started out like any other Sunday -- reading the paper and drinking coffee -- while our three kids slept in. That morning, the cover story on the Sunday New York Times magazine was, "The Virtues of Infidelity," which argued that cheating can make your marriage stronger. I devoured it then handed it to Chris. After he finished the article, he looked up at me and said, "What do you think?" For almost three hours, we sat on the deck and discussed and considered the possibility, implications and tactics of having an open marriage. Would you want to know who I was sleeping with? How would you protect yourself and protect me? Are people we know off limits? Is this a one off thing, or do you envision having an ongoing relationship with a lover? Over the years, we've had lots of conversations about sexuality but none as serious as this one. This didn't feel like the many times we've discussed the fact that monogamy isn't natural; it's work. Or our sexual "hall pass" lists. Or how cheaters cheat because deep down they seek distraction from their lives. This felt more like we were standing on the edge of a cliff and daring one another to jump off. I thought I was socially liberal, until I thought about sharing my husband with someone else. You may think, like I did, that an open marriage means you are simply open to having sex with other partners. But as we dug deeper into the reality, the desires and the fears that come with the territory -- we realized it is not that simple. When you step outside your marriage and into another person's bed you may say its "just sex" -- but in reality you just invited that person to step into your whole life, and they probably will. You'll be in your kitchen, with your spouse, when the texts appear on your phone. Are you free Saturday? You'll be driving in your car with your kids, when the song that reminds you of your lover plays. And suddenly, they are right there in the car with you. What I discovered about myself was interesting. It wasn't the idea of Chris having sex with someone else that truly bothered me. I can even admit that if I envision a particular Victoria's Secret supermodel with him -- it's actually a turn-on. What crippled me was the realization that while you can compartmentalize the physicality of sex in your mind, you can't keep real intimacy separated from real life. The idea of an outsider having access into our life, our family, our world and the power that comes with it ... that scared the hell out of me, and it scared him, too. An orgasm with a stranger no longer felt exciting and fulfilling; it felt dangerous. Yes, we considered an open marriage, and decided that for now ours will remain closed. If you've wondered whether an open marriage works -- and really who hasn't -- I dare you to have the conversation with your spouse. If you are honest, open-minded and you listen, you'll be surprised by what you learn about yourself, your life and your marriage. At the end of the day, whether you decide to sleep with people outside your marriage or are planning to enjoy one partner for the rest of your days, the true definition of an open marriage has nothing to do with sex.

            <corpo>(CNN)It's safe to say few tears have been shed by women in science over the resignation of Nobel-winning scientist Sir Tim Hunt after his now infamous comments regarding his experience of "girls" in laboratories. "Three things happen when they are in the lab; you fall in love with them, they fall in love with you and when you criticize them, they cry," Hunt said, prompting outcry, then condemnation and now mirth. On Twitter, the "girls" of science are doing their best to prove how #distractinglysexy they are, by posting pictures of themselves at work. Some are even seen posing with poop. Anne Hilborn tweets: "I was so #distractinglysexy when collecting cheetah crap that even I lost track of what I was doing and dropped some." And cows. "Here I am shoulder-deep in cow rectum, so seductive!" tweets Vanessa Adams. Alongside photos of herself wearing protective gear and heavy boots, Twitter user @xLiserx laments, "Guess I can't save the lives of my geological counterparts - I'm too #distractinglysexy to the team. As if!" Charlene Blomquist, who describes herself as a science nerd, said she had posted the only photo she had of herself "where my mascara isn't running from all the crying." University College of London announced Hunt's resignation on Wednesday, with a brief statement saying: "UCL can confirm that Sir Tim Hunt FRS has today resigned from his position as Honorary Professor with the UCL Faculty of Life Sciences, following comments he made about women in science at the World Conference of Science Journalists on 9 June." "UCL was the first university in England to admit women students on equal terms to men, and the university believes that this outcome is compatible with our commitment to gender equality." Steve Diggle, a microbiologist from the University of Nottingham stepped in with a ready-made sign to address Hunt's concerns about coed labs. "Caution: Mixed Gender Lab! No falling in love or crying permitted" After the initial outcry, Hunt apologized in an interview with the BBC for any offense his comments had caused, but said that he stood by them. "I did mean the part about having trouble with girls. It is true that people -- I have fallen in love with people in the lab and people in the lab have fallen in love with me and it's very disruptive to the science because it's terribly important that in a lab people are on a level playing field," he said. "I found that these emotional entanglements made life very difficult. "I'm really, really sorry I caused any offense, that's awful. I certainly didn't mean that. I just meant to be honest, actually," he added. Some came to Hunt's defense, questioning whether his resignation amounted to a curb on free speech. "Seems London's Professors are not allowed free speech at UCL as #TimHunt resigns. It's all @uclnews to me," tweeted Barbara Cookson, a European patent lawyer and IP expert. Hunt was part of the team that won the Nobel Prize in physiology in 2001 for the discovery of key regulators of the cell cycle.

            <descricao>Officials have released some of the frantic 911 calls that were made when floodwaters tore through Texas recently.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)In an early 911 call, she sounds cool and collected, if a little alarmed. "The water is up to the second story in the house," says Laura McComb. "It's coming up to the second floor. I mean, it's so high up. And we have no exit out." She called from a vacation cabin in Wimberley, Texas, which was hit with heavy rains and flooding last month. As the nearby Blanco River swelled, the house was knocked loose, sweeping McComb, her husband, their children and others into the water. A little while later, another call comes in to 911 from the same location. This time, the woman does not identify herself, but there is panic in her voice. "Our house is down! We're floating," she says. And still later, another 911 call. A man who identifies himself as Brian says he just saw a house go by on the river. "There was someone in it with a bright light trying to flash us," he said. "They've already hit the bridge, I'm sure." At least 23 people were killed across the state in the floods, including Laura McComb, and at least one of her two children. Her husband survived. Their second child is missing. Over the weekend, searchers found the body of Randy Charba. He had also been in the house, along with his wife and child. His wife died; their child is still missing. Torrential rains in May caused widespread flooding in Texas, inundating businesses, knocking out bridges and sweeping some homes from their foundations. More than 37 trillion gallons of water fell on the state last month, according to the National Weather Service. The storms also caused destruction and deaths in Oklahoma and Mexico. CNN's Michael Pearson contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Most diverse place in America is not where you think - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>A neighborhood in Anchorage lies in the most diverse census tract in America and life there is far from the stereotype of Alaska.</descricao>
            <corpo>Anchorage, Alaska (CNN)The shelves at the Red Apple Market are a giveaway. Dried squid. Sambal Olek chili paste. Corned Australian mutton. Canned grass jelly. Another clue: Ride the crowded No. 45 bus, which meanders down Mountain View Drive, and you hear chatter in seven languages -- none, English. That these markers of diversity are in a neighborhood in Anchorage may surprise folks from the Lower 48 who picture Alaska as a largely homogenous and snowy American extremity. But Alaskans are quite proud of their distinctive demographics. Remember Sarah Palin's much-parodied 2008 interview with Katie Couric? One segment ended with this line: "Believe me, Alaska is like a microcosm of America." Palin was taken to task for her claim because Alaska's black and Latino populations are lower than the national average. And yet ... Mountain View, a northeast Anchorage neighborhood, boasts the most diverse census tract in all of America. That's according to University of Alaska sociology professor Chad Farrell, who analyzed the census data. In fact, Farrell says the country's three most diverse census tracts are all in Anchorage, followed by a handful in Queens, as in New York, which usually tops everyone's diversity guess list. Mao Tosi, an American Samoan and former NFL defensive end, returned to Mountain View after his career with the Arizona Cardinals ended. He wanted to be a part of this rapid change and help the Samoan community assimilate. "This place is a snapshot into America's future," says Tosi, his 6-foot-6 frame casting an imposing shadow in the Northway Mall that he operates. He speaks of a future in which America will no longer be majority white. Most predictions say that will happen by the middle of this century, and Tosi thinks the nation can take a cue or two from Mountain View. "Kids are growing up here without knowing the color of their skin," he says. "They are more influenced by what their neighbor is doing."  So how exactly did Mountain View score so high in diversity? Farrell explains the index he used to measure diversity: He looked at the number of ethnic and racial groups, but more importantly, he studied their size relative to one another. Farrell found that two things boosted Mountain View to the top. First, there is a sizable white population left. In many other places, neighborhoods that have increased in diversity have also seen white flight. Not so in Mountain View. Mountain View also has a significant Alaska Native population, which other cities in America lack. Alaska's diversity has spiked in recent years for a host of reasons. Among them are its economy, which prospered when other states were reeling from recession, because it is driven by fishing and oil. The state is also home to nine military bases, and Mountain View butts up to Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson. Hawaiian businessman William Hoopai recently opened a new restaurant on the main drag called West Berlin. Yup. Schnitzels and sauerkraut attract a lot of uniformed men and women who have spent time in Germany. And there has been new immigration to Alaska -- including refugees from troubled nations such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Somalia, Cuba, Iran and Bhutan. Many have resettled here in Mountain View. Omima Adam, a civil engineer from Sudan, arrived in 2010. "I was so shocked when I saw all that snow," she says from the window of her food truck, Sultan Shawarma, parked between a Dominican place and an espresso stand. "But I'd rather be cold than dead," she says of the bloodshed in her native Darfur. She learned English and puts her heart and soul into her kibbes, shawarmas and falafel. She wants to turn the business into a full-fledged restaurant and return to college to earn an engineering degree that the United States will recognize. Mountain View was her new beginning.  It's obvious this is not a wealthy place. Between the colorful new houses built by Cook Inlet Housing Authority lie scarred and tattered structures with molting paint and boarded windows. Mountain View Boulevard is lined with stores such as Price Busters and Cash America Pawn. The big anchor stores all abandoned Northway Mall, Alaska's first enclosed one. The last census counted 39% of households as earning less than $25,000; 19% fall below the poverty line. That explains why Alice "Mother" Lawrence's house is full every afternoon. The 79-year-old runs a nonprofit that collects foods that have exhausted their shelf lives in local groceries and distributes them to the hungry. Bread, pastries, fruits, vegetables, snacks, soft drinks. She landed here in 1967 as a military wife. She had a lot of kids and after her first husband left her, she learned how to get tough. "No one helped me here," she says. "They wouldn't give me a penny." That's when she found the Lord and her calling in life: to help the needy. She acquired a Casio keyboard and lined up seven church pews in her living room to minister to the poor. Her son, Randy Lawrence, says people he knows in other states say: "What? There are black people in Alaska?" Mountain View's census tract is 13.1% African-American, which is about the national average. Lawrence, 49, describes Anchorage as a wannabe bad-ass city. "It's not," he laughs as he unloads boxes of day-old cinnamon buns. "As for Mountain View? It's the 'hood. This is as bad as it gets around here." Yeah, there's gangs and drugs and other kinds of crime that's inextricably linked to poverty. But he likes living in a smaller place that is so racially mixed. "As a black man, I have to say you got a better shot at life here," he said, comparing it with New Jersey, where he was born. Carnard Davis, 44, agrees. He moved here from the now-demolished Bowen Homes housing project in southwest Atlanta and works at the Boys and Girls Club, where he's simply known as Mr. C. "I came here on vacation and saw how smooth and easy it was here," he says. "And I wanted a change." The club is full on this cold afternoon with kids from at least a dozen places. They don't all speak English well, but Davis says it doesn't matter. On the wall is a poster board with the question: "What does this place mean to you?" Many of the answers say, "family." One says: "This is a place I can be me."  Mountain View wasn't always a global petri dish. It grew up as a first-ring suburb that was annexed by Anchorage in the 1950s. It boomed as the place that accommodated transient oil workers who came for jobs on the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. The history is reflected in Mountain View's housing, a low-cost stock that consists of numerous duplexes and apartment complexes, which in turn attracted people looking for low-rent places in a state where high construction costs make decent housing expensive. After the pipeline was finished, Mountain View fell into decline. Crime soared in the 1980s and 1990s and the neighborhood got a bad rap. Architectural designer Clark Yerrington moved here in 1999 and recalls how his friends were shocked. It was common to hear people in Anchorage at that time say: "Never move into a neighborhood that ends with 'view.' " Mountain View and Fairview, named for their proximity to the Chugach Mountains, had become unsafe. In the height of the crack cocaine era, the blocks around Yerrington's house were "switched on all night." "It was sketchy," says Yerrington, who is white. "I moved here because it was affordable. I did not expect to be here long." His friends refused to visit him. But he's glad he stayed. Mountain View has been bouncing back in recent years, says Kirk Rose, executive director of the Anchorage Community Land Trust, which has purchased and rehabilitated properties and encourages revitalization. A credit union converted an eyesore gas station and opened the first financial institution around these parts. Before that, there were only pawn shops that charged 20% for cashing a check, Rose says. "The credit union has added 3,000 new accounts," he says. And growth around Mountain View has helped. Olive Garden opened last year (a big deal), and now clothing giant H&amp;M has announced it's coming to Anchorage (an even bigger deal). That's the buzz on the street. Key to Mountain View is its strong housing authority, which has shepherded construction of affordable homes. One reason the homes are cheaper is because buyers only pay for the house. The housing authority owns the land. The better housing has helped change the neighborhood from being largely transient to one where people want to stay, Rose says. "And that is so important for the health of a community." Yerrington proudly displays a collection of photos on his dining room wall. They are of houses in Mountain View, each a representation of a place he finds unique. There's no white part of town. No Aleut village. Or Chinatown. There are no set patterns. "We all live together. Even white people like me. Think how it would be if the whole country had been organized like this. It does people good to break out of their comfort zone and mix with neighbors who are different." And there's one more thing. It's Alaska. Yerrington's home is surrounded by wilderness and wildlife. Mountains and moose. He can't think of another place in America quite like this.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>New York escaped convicts called cunning and evil - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Escaped convicts Richard Matt and Richard Sweat have a violent past and are still on the run.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Escaped murderer Richard Matt is the definition of the word "evil," a former accomplice told CNN. Lee Bates, who saw Matt snap his victim's neck in 1997, told CNN's "Anderson Cooper 360" that what Matt did during a 27-hour kidnapping that led to murder was heinous. "Torture is probably an understatement," Bates told CNN by phone. He said Matt shoved a knife sharpener in his victim's ear at one point then beat and punched William Rickerson in an attempt to get money from the businessman. When Rickerson didn't comply, Matt broke his neck then dismembered the body. Bates, who drove the car in which Rickerson was tied up, testified in 2008 against Matt and is concerned the escapee might seek revenge. He said he was scared of Matt during their crimes and was scared of him now. The one-time accomplice told CNN that he knows Matt put a lot of thought into planning his latest jailbreak. "He is a very cunning and dangerous individual," said Bates, who was convicted 17 years ago of second-degree murder. He served 15 years. Matt and another inmate from the Clinton Correctional Facility in northern New York, David Sweat, now are trying to figure out their next move, following a weekend prison escape. The escape -- which involved power tools, navigating a maze of pipes through and out of the prison -- seems so unexplainable at the outset that even cliches fail to describe it. A daring escape? Brazen? Perplexing?  All those things, kind of. The pair used decoys to make it look like they were sleeping while they tunneled their way out. Both men, Matt and Sweat, are convicted murderers. And the biggest question beside "How did they do it?" is "What could they have planned next?" As the pair's back stories emerged, more was known about Matt than Sweat. Sweat, 35, was serving a life sentence without parole in the killing of Kevin Tarsia, a sheriff's deputy, in 2002. Sweat and another man robbed a gun store, and when confronted by Tarsia, responded by fatally shooting him. The slain deputy's siblings on Monday said they couldn't understand how their brother's killer escaped. How did no one hear the power tools Sweat and Matt used to make a hole? Sharon Tarsia asked. Steven Tarsia said he was surprised to learn the escapees had adjoining cells in an "honor block" reserved for inmates with the best behavior. "I was under the assumption that they would never get anything. Their lives would be miserable, and awful. That's what we wanted," Steven Tarsia said.  Gabriel DiBernardo, who was the lead detective in the investigation into Rickerson's death in 1997, said he was not completely surprised about the jailbreak. Matt had escaped from jail once before, in 1986. According to the Buffalo News, he was on the lam for four days before being recaptured. "He has a history," DiBernardo said. "He broke out of jail before. He is a cunning individual, no question about it, and a vicious individual." Bates said it's possible Matt got someone who worked at the prison to help the escapees, who had adjoining cells. "He can make friends easy. He's a master manipulator," Bates said. DiBernardo said he wouldn't be surprised if Matt had more to do with the escape than Sweat. According to a Buffalo News report from before Matt's trial, he had been in Mexico, where he allegedly killed another man. He was accused of killing a man in Matamoros, Mexico, outside a bar and served nine years in a Mexican jail. During his trial for murder of Rickerson, Matt's attorney said his client never had a trial in Mexico and "suffered indignities that we wouldn't impose on stray animals in our country." Matt worked for Rickerson and was fired for poor performance just weeks before Rickerson's murder, according to coverage of the trial. Reports from the trial included another telling anecdote: During the trial, Matt wore electrodes on his ankles or waist that could be triggered by a guard if needed while inside the courtroom. The Buffalo News noted yet another twist: The day after Matt's conviction, a police detective and former friend of Matt received a note from the inmate. The note accused the detective of having lied during the trial, and said, "You also make it very clear that we are not friends. I'll remember both ..." The ellipsis left the note open-ended. During the Rickerson trial, the issue of Matt's previous jailbreak came up. His defense attorney explained it this way at the time: "He told me, 'I was 22 then. I climbed a fence. I couldn't do that now.'" CNN's Deborah Feyerick, Camille Cava and Chris Welch contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>A cinematic guide to Jeb Bush - CNNPolitics.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>John Ellis Bush is the son of one president and the brother of another. And he's taking up the family business.</descricao>
            <corpo>Washington (CNN)John Ellis Bush -- Jeb -- is the son of one president and the brother of another. And he's taking up the family business. Sorry, John and John Quincy Adams, the Bush family is gunning for your presidential record. Here's a guide to the third Bush who would be president. Bush's name has been thrown around as a potential candidate for 2016 virtually since the end of the last election. He was the governor of Florida until 2007, and has mostly been doing consulting work since, which was probably about as exciting as it sounds. Taking a cue from soap operas, Bush embarked on the will-he-or-won't-he tour of the century. If there's one way to shake things up, it's to run for president. Or at least to talk about running for president, which Jeb has made into an art. He isn't even running yet and Jeb has already had to spend time addressing questions about his brother George's legacy in Iraq. Jeb's father, George H.W. Bush, also had problems of his own in the Middle East. The Bush family's legacy in Iraq is one of the things that will inevitably haunt Jeb down the campaign trail. George served in the White House for eight years, so the Iraq questions could just be the tip of the iceberg for Jeb. There's also policy toward Cuba and education to think about. Then again, it might be a no-brainer for Jeb since he and his brother are pretty similar on a lot of issues, including hugs. (They're pro-hug.) Despite insisting that he is his own man on foreign policy issues, Jeb has also cited his brother as one of his foreign policy advisers when it comes to the Middle East. Perhaps in an attempt to show that he can think for himself and forge his own international relations, Jeb planned a trip to Europe. But escaping his family's foreign policy legacy abroad may be the least of Jeb's worries. As other American politicians -- some of them presidential hopefuls -- have learned the hard way, there's more than one way to step in it when you're abroad. One of Jeb's most appealing traits as a member of the GOP is his commitment to Hispanic voters. He served as governor of Florida and his wife is from Mexico. He even mistakenly marked himself Hispanic on a voter form. Over the years he's become fluent in Spanish, and not just for the purposes of being able to order a proper Cuban sandwich during downtime in Miami. The Hispanic vote helped President Barack Obama win in 2012. George got 44% of the Hispanic vote in 2004, so the party has been able to attract Hispanic votes in the past. Jeb has been one of many politicians to reach out the Latino community, but he's fared much better than most of his competitors. At the end of the primary season, if Jeb Bush comes out on top, he'll be nowhere near finished. He could very well face-off against another member of a major political family: Hillary Clinton. Eight of the last nine presidential elections have seen a Bush or a Clinton vying for a spot in the White House. The Clintons and the Bushes have been doing battle since the '90s. Could a showdown between Jeb and Hillary force the end of a recent truce between the families?  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Jerry Seinfeld doesn't get political correctness (Opinion)  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>What Jerry Seinfeld calls "political correctness" can be better described as a generation gap. </descricao>
            <corpo>Dean Obeidallah, a former attorney, is the host of SiriusXM's weekly program "The Dean Obeidallah Show." He is a columnist for The Daily Beast and editor of the politics blog The Dean's Report. He's also the co-director of the documentary "The Muslims Are Coming!" Follow him on Twitter: @TheDeansreport. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)"What's the deal with political correctness?" That line should be said in the voice and cadence of Jerry Seinfeld. You see, back in 2014, Seinfeld railed against political correctness when asked why guests on his "Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee" Web series were mostly white men. He also remarked that the idea pop culture has to "represent the actual pie chart of America" is "PC nonsense." Rather, the focus should be, "Are you making us laugh or not?" Well, Seinfeld is at it again. This time the comedian's focus is political correctness among college students. Seinfeld told ESPN radio recently, "I don't play colleges, but I hear a lot of people tell me, 'Don't go near colleges. They're so PC.' " He added that younger people "just want to use these words: 'That's racist;' 'That's sexist;' 'That's prejudice.' They don't know what ... they're talking about." On the one hand, Seinfeld is 100% correct. On the other hand, he is way, way off. Seinfeld is right that college students can be very PC. I have seen it firsthand when I performed standup comedy or gave lectures on college campuses. College students react to jokes about issues of race, gender, or sexual orientation differently than many people in their 40s, 50s and older. In fact, on several occasions, college students have come up to me after shows to explain that they were "concerned" with one of my jokes. Typically, they had read something into the joke that I had not intended. We would discuss the joke, but they never demanded I stop telling it. Where Seinfeld and I disagree is that I don't see "political correctness" as being inherently bad -- unless it goes way overboard. To me, "political correctness" is about being respectful to minorities -- be it based on race, religion, sexual orientation, or ethnicity. And where I greatly disagree with Seinfeld is that based on my experiences of performing on college campuses, I believe young adults for the most part really get racism, sexism, and other -- isms. For example, I have been in shows where comedians told very sexist or homophobic jokes. These same jokes would elicit good laughs in comedy clubs, but were met with numerous objections by college students. The students have every right to voice their views about these jokes. I think what Seinfeld is missing is the "why" behind the reactions of college students. READ: Why some comedians don't like college campuses Chris Rock summed it up well in December when he announced he would no longer play colleges because the students are too PC. Rock said that because of the way kids are raised today, you can't even mention race: "You can't say 'The black kid over there.' No, it's 'The guy with the red shoes.' " Rock is right that people are raised differently today. Kids nowadays grow up in more multicultural nation than Seinfeld, Rock or I did. I have joked that I grew up in a town where the diversity was limited to two groups: You were either Italian or you were my father. (He was of Arab heritage while my mother is Sicilian.) When I was a kid, if someone told a joke about other ethnicities or races, we would simply laugh if the joke was funny. No one analyzed it; we never would have thought of doing that. Partly, it's because the butt of the jokes were groups of people we didn't know personally. Flash forward to today. Even in seventh grade -- as my niece informed me -- students are taught to be sensitive toward other races and cultures. This impacts not only the way they view the world, but also their view of comedy. So what Seinfeld calls "political correctness" can be better described as a generation gap. Comedy tastes evolve to reflect the cultural norms of the time. It's why comedians from the 1950s like Henny Youngman -- famous for his "Take my wife ... please" joke -- wasn't popular with younger people in the late 1960s. That generation gravitated toward comedians like Richard Pryor and George Carlin who weren't telling jokes about wives, but about things like race and politics. Every comedian has a choice to perform at colleges. But don't blame college students for wanting comedy that fits their own sensibilities. Why should any audience have to change their comedy tastes to fit a comedian's act? Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

            <cabecalho>No, America shouldn't go metric - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Why Lincoln Chafee's call for America to switch to the metric system is misplaced.</descricao>
            <corpo>John Bemelmans Marciano is the author of 'Whatever happened to the metric system?'. The views expressed are his own. (CNN)There is much to be admired about newly announced presidential candidate Lincoln Chafee's willingness to take unconventional political stands. But as he announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination on Thursday there was one proposal I wish he hadn't suggested: that America should switch to the metric system. The idea that we should change our daily system of weights and measures is certainly bold. However, Chafee's putting it forth as a kind of apology to the world for the last dozen years of U.S. international behavior -- rather than on the basis of how much it would cost the American people and what benefits it would bring them -- is staggeringly wrong-headed. Don't get me wrong -- the metric system is one of the greatest tools ever invented. It is already the first language of measurement in science classes around the country. The first time I ever heard my kindergarten daughter use a measure, it was for something that she said stood "about four meters off the ground". (She also likes soccer.) The metric system is as preeminent in American industry as it is in schools. Manufacturers in this country made a massive push toward the metric system in the early 1970s, which became part of a drive to take the nation metric as a whole. Then-President Gerald Ford signed the Metric Conversion Act in 1975. The main resistance -- aside from everyday citizens -- came from the unions, who feared that a switch to an international system of measurement would make it easier for big corporations to ship jobs offshore. (They were right.) The spread of the metric system is a triumph not of science but international capitalism. Nowhere was it adopted out of idealism and pure reason. If it had been, the 10-hour clock -- another component of the original metric system -- would've been adopted too. With U.S. competitiveness not at stake, what reason is there for America to switch? In an age when we can say "three feet to meters" and our smartphone immediately tells us .9144m, it can't be about making conversion easy. The only reason for us to switch is exactly the one Chafee brings up -- that it would be "good for our international reputation." Yet beyond this being of questionable logic -- would it really net enough good PR to justify the billions in dollars it would cost us to convert? -- there is the underlying notion that it is bad for us to be out step with the rest of the world. Isn't the world already becoming the same enough? The typical progressive response would be yes, it is, and we need to save and savor our differences. This makes the disregard that many otherwise progressive folks have toward our customary measures so puzzling. If one regrets languages and dialects dying out by the hundreds, why would that person then want to put to rest our own language of measurement? If he or she fears that a piece of world heritage might be destroyed at Palmyra by the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, why would they be so quick to condemn to the dustbin a piece of world heritage safeguarded by our own culture? And world heritage it certainly is: our customary measures encompass ways of measurement that date to pre-history and were in continuous use in every culture, everywhere prior to the metric system's global dominance. A move to the meter is not a vote for open-mindedness. That has been clear to me every time I have been scolded by a European or South American on the stupidity of a system that divides by twelfths and sixteenths rather than tenths. I readily admit that the decimal math of the metric system is easier, but not that it is in all ways better. The fact is that decimals are lousy at real-life division. Try cutting an orange or a pizza into five or ten slices. Two of the most basic fractions are the third and the quarter. A third and quarter of a foot are four and three inches; the same for a meter are 25cm and .33333-on-to-infinity cm. In a time when our world is becoming ever-more abstract and artificial, it is ever-more important that we keep a grip on what is essential and real. Think of trying to remember different units another way. Learning other languages isn't only a benefit in the international workplace, it makes you realize that there is more than one way to approach everything in this world. The same goes for learning two systems of measurement. It allows us to recognize that distance, weight, and volume can be measured and conceived of in more than one way. Those who have grown up with only the metric system find this an alien and unpleasant concept. But don't blame them -- they've only ever had to learn one system. In the 21st century, Americans have to learn two. That's an advantage that Lincoln Chafee should embrace. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

            <descricao>A Russian fighter jet, flying at high speed, came within 10 feet of a U.S. Air Force reconnaissance aircraft in international airspace over the Black Sea.</descricao>
            <corpo>Washington (CNN)A Russian fighter jet, flying at high speed, came within 10 feet of a U.S. Air Force reconnaissance aircraft in international airspace over the Black Sea late last month, several U.S. officials told CNN Thursday. The Russian jet flew alongside the U.S. plane at the same altitude, broke off, and then shadowed the plane before leaving the area in the May 30 incident, the officials said. The U.S. aircraft took no evasive measures, and no other details were immediately available. Military officials could not say whether a diplomatic protest had been filed. The close call comes weeks after another incident between the U.S. and Russia over the skies of Europe, when a U.S. RC-135U flying a routine route in international airspace was intercepted by a Russian SU-27 Flanker in what authorities called an "unsafe and unprofessional manner." And earlier this month, the U.S. Navy took the unusual step of releasing video of Russian Su-24 aircraft flying past the right side of the guided missile destroyer USS Ross in the Black Sea. The video was distributed to make clear that the airplanes and ship had a routine encounter, contrary to Russian reports. It shows a warplane approaching from the distance and then quickly zooming past the American vessel. The Russian aircraft were not armed, according to a U.S. defense official, and the entire matter was considered routine. The U.S. officials say because there are more military aircraft from NATO and Russia flying over the Black Sea and the Baltics, there are more interactions. However, the two air incidents are of particular concern because of the danger they posed to U.S. aircraft and personnel. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated which sea the jets were flying over. It was the Black Sea. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>'Female Viagra'? Women should be able to choose  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Panel recommends that FDA approve controversial pill to boost women's sex desire. If side effects are small, it should be available to women who want it.</descricao>
            <corpo>Pepper Schwartz is professor of sociology at the University of Washington and the author of many books, the latest of which is "The Normal Bar." She is the love and relationship ambassador for AARP and writes the Naked Truth column for AARP.org. She is also a senior fellow at the Council on Contemporary Families, a nonprofit organization that gathers research on American families. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)Does she really have a headache? And if not, could a little pink pill help? For the most part, we know that for many women, the only "headache" that is causing her to avoid sex is fatigue or relationship issues. (If it were George Clooney asking for sex, that headache might miraculously disappear.) But I don't believe that being tired or out of sorts are the only reasons women lose desire. Which is why the possibility of a "female Viagra" is intriguing -- and appealing: the idea that a pill could restore libido in women, just the way Viagra has improved the hydraulics for millions of men. On Thursday, an advisory committee for the Food and Drug Administration voted to recommend approval of flibanserin, a desire-boosting pill that the agency has rejected twice before. The move came after an organization recently launched a pressure campaign, backed in part by the drug's developer, to push the FDA for approval, saying gender bias has kept such a pill from women. It's a complicated issue, no question. But some women are genuinely upset about their loss of libido. They are searching for help and deserve to have it. In so many sexuality and relationship workshops I have conducted with women, I have heard the following lament: "I love my husband. I used to crave making love with him. But now I feel nothing. I wish I could reclaim my sexual desire and sexual pleasure." In these cases I don't think it's the relationship that's the issue, or having a partner who is sexually inept, or the effect of memories from earlier sexual trauma. No, something else is going on. That said, it is not clear what will help a woman who lacks desire and has little ability to be aroused. Consider: Early clinical trials for Viagra to see if it would stimulate women's sexual desire didn't do so well. One study by psychologists Andrea Bradford and Cindy Meston found that if women thought they were taking a sexual arousal drug but were instead taking a placebo, they still reported a rise in libido. These authors found an almost uniform rise in libido, particularly if the women were in a long relationship. The "placebo effect" is powerful ... so powerful that it is very difficult to get a drug passed by the FDA because, quite reasonably, a new drug needs to be more effective than the results that occur in the placebo control group. This was initially believed to be the case with flibanserin. Furthermore, even some of the people who voted to recommend the drug were worried that the results were small and side effects were worrisome, although not huge (mostly nausea and fainting). Dr. Julia Heiman, a respected psychologist and past head of the Kinsey Institute, once joked with me that she sometimes wished it was possible to sell a placebo as the real thing because then you could get the same results for a lot of people without any side effects at all. But the fierce fight between advocates of a desire drug and doctors and psychologists who believe that the approval of flibanserin creates a pathological condition where none exists is no laughing matter. One side hopes for a pill to help solve desire problems; the other looks to natural attenuation of desire or to psychological and relationship issues. The fact remains that there is medical evidence that not all desire is impeded by interpersonal or intrapersonal issues. We know, for example, that "stress hormones" make sexual desire unlikely. We also know that many modern medications, for example anti-depression drugs or drugs used to treat heart disease, cancer and diabetes, will affect desire and sexual ability -- so why is it unthinkable that some women's current physiological functioning impedes sexual response? And could be helped with medicine? I know this has become a feminist issue. But interestingly enough, there are feminists on both sides of the debate: Some support the search for a pill, and believe that women deserve a desire drug, and others feel this is just another plot to label women as dysfunctional when there is evidence that losing sexual desire over the life cycle may be a natural consequence of hormonal change that doesn't need to be fixed. I get both sides, but I have landed on the former. Even if loss of sexual desire is normal in some women, it is not optimal. I am not, for example, as physically strong as I used to be, but I know if I work out I can be stronger than if I don't. Am I rejecting nature? Correct: I am. Nature may take us some places we don't want to go -- and if an exercise regimen, a pill or even a tummy tuck (not done yet, but I would consider it!) help us resist changes we do not want to accept, I'm all for it. Up to a point. Any new regimen has to be safe and effective. I presume that the panel on flibanserin decided that the benefits were high enough, and the side effects low enough, to recommend the drug. The "pill" has to work better than a placebo and the side effects have to be reasonable and unlikely. I understand that there are some side effects, but let's face it, nothing is cost free and most women who yearn for their lost desire would likely be happy to take on moderate costs to new jump-start their sex lives. For myself, the capacity for sexual desire is an important part of my identity and my pleasure in life. If it were ever to go away spontaneously, I would be first in line for that little pill.

            <cabecalho>The '70s: When TV finally woke up to reality - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>From sitcoms to variety shows and TV movies, the decade turned topical and polarizing, as it stepped up to he issues challenging and dividing the country. </descricao>
            <corpo>David Bianculli is founder and editor of TVWorthWatching.com and teaches TV and film at Rowan University in New Jersey. He also is TV critic and guest host for NPR's "Fresh Air" with Terry Gross. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. (CNN)Every decade of television seems to evolve and differentiate itself, almost naturally, with a new level of exploration and growth. In the 1950s, we had the so-called "golden age of television," when live anthology dramas gave us such groundbreaking works as Paddy Chayefsky's "Marty," Rod Serling's "Patterns," and Reginald Rose's "Twelve Angry Men." In the '60s, TV news matured by covering increasingly volatile news events, from assassinations and race relations to the Vietnam War. And in the '70s, television entertainment finally did what the news division had done the decade before: It became topical, and often intentionally polarizing, as it explored the issues challenging and dividing the country. The '70s were a bridge decade -- delivering us into an era of what we think of as "quality television." It would lead, ultimately to NBC's pioneering "Hill Street Blues" and a raft of taboo-challenging cable networks in the '80s. Without the advancements of the '70s, in comedy as well as drama, we would have no "Breaking Bad," no "Daily Show," and no "True Detective." Daily coverage of the explosive Watergate hearings, quickly relegated -- in prime time -- to PBS, put the nascent organization of public television securely on the map, as revelations by such witnesses as John Dean riveted the country. The Carter campaign against incumbent President Gerald Ford ushered in a new post-Watergate approach in political coverage in TV news. Reports became more forceful and more openly questioned political authority. And the ongoing hostage crisis in Iran, which wasn't resolved until the day Ronald Reagan assumed the presidency in 1981, gave TV viewers not only a hard look at the long-term ramifications of American foreign policy, but also gave birth to ABC's "Nightline" and provided a major justification for the launch of CNN as a 24-hour news operation in 1980. But so did the rise, early in the '70s of entertainment television that embraced and even sought out controversy rather than avoided it. The same CBS executives who fired variety show hosts the Smothers brothers from their self-titled show at the end of the '60s -- basically for insubordination, and for taking on issues like the Vietnam war -- turned around, at the start of the '70s, and gave us, in quick succession, the overt feminism of "The Mary Tyler Moore Show," the taboo-busting "All in the Family," and the anti-war comedy "M*A*S*H." But it wasn't just about executives deciding to court a new generation of viewers. It was the viewers themselves, who signified -- by showing up in giant viewing blocks -- that they not only accepted entertainment content that meant something, they were hungry for it: The feminist heroine of "Maude" getting an abortion. Guest host Richard Pryor on "Saturday Night Live" reacting to the "N-word" in a first-season sketch with Chevy Chase. The miniseries "Roots," which delved into all of black history by tracing the family tree of author Alex Haley. Talk shows became more significant in the '70s, in part because of the insistence of their hosts to follow their own interests. Johnny Carson, while ruling late night for decades, used his clout in the '70s to make stars of the likes of "Cosmos" host Carl Sagan, while talk host Dick Cavett, on PBS and elsewhere, interviewed Watergate investigators and co-conspirators, key artistic figures of the '70s (John Lennon, Gore Vidal, Jimi Hendrix), and just about anyone else who made a major cultural impact. It was also a decade in which another programming genre, the TV variety show, reached its zenith, with the genial humor of "The Carol Burnett Show" and "The Dean Martin Show," and the short-lived but daringly different anthology approach of "The Great American Dream Machine." (When The Captain and Tennille and Starland Vocal Band could get their own variety shows, it was time to pull the plug on this genre.) And of course, it was a decade in which sketch comedy hit a new golden era, with everything from "Monty Python's Flying Circus" and "Saturday Night Live" to "Second City TV" and "The Muppet Show." These shows led, directly if not indirectly, to just about every bold sketch series on TV since and even now, from Dave Chappelle and "In Living Color" to Amy Schumer and "Louie." It indeed was a time, as the Pythons often said in their charmingly nonsensical transitions, "for something completely different." But back to that sitcom form: This was what made the biggest and most important transformation of all in the '70s. The "Mary Tyler Moore Show," showcasing its central character, Mary Richards, as a single "career woman" in Minneapolis, was far more "liberal" than such TV precursors as Eve Arden's "Our Miss Brooks" in the 1950s or Marlo Thomas' "That Girl" in the 1960s, where career focus always took a back seat to finding, luring or keeping a man. Simply by having its central character focus on her job, the show gave the women's liberation movement a weekly boost -- while the independent TV production company it launched, MTM Productions, developed a seminal stretch of superb comedies and dramas, including "The Bob Newhart Show" and "St. Elsewhere," that essentially initiated the modern age of quality television. "All in the Family," starring Carroll O'Connor as bigoted taxi driver Archie Bunker, was the starting point in producer Norman Lear's domination of TV sitcoms in the decade. By intentionally probing and showcasing sensitive topics and hot-button issues, from racism to abortion, "All in the Family" and its many spinoffs, including "Maude," "Good Times" and "The Jeffersons," confronted viewers with the type of controversies, and language, that had been considered taboo in a prime-time that had earlier favored witches, genies and flying nuns. Even sitcoms not produced by Lear, but focusing intentionally on race or place, owed a debt to him, from "Chico and the Man" to "Sanford &amp; Son" and the multi-ethnic classroom of "Welcome Back, Kotter," the unlikely launching pad for John Travolta. "M*A*S*H," a TV spinoff of the bold Robert Altman comedy movie, did something unprecedented for a TV sitcom. It positioned itself as an anti-war comedy at a time when the United States itself was mired in an increasingly unpopular war in Vietnam. "M*A*S*H" was set in the '50s, during the Korean War, but as an allegory pushing for peace and serving as a constant reminder of the human cost of war, it reigned for more than a decade as one of TV's most popular comedies. Times definitely were changing -- and in other TV areas as well. The miniseries truly exploded in the '70s, first with the PBS import of "Upstairs, Downstairs" (a precursor of "Downton Abbey"), then with ABC's "Rich Man, Poor Man" and the groundbreaking, record-shattering "Roots" in 1977, the finale of which drew an astounding 51%of all U.S. TV households. That translates to 100 million viewers for the finale alone, placing it, still, among the most popular entertainment programs ever televised. In "Roots," author Alex Haley traced his family tree back -- from an African youth abducted and sold into slavery in the United States, to a southern plantation owner. It became the most popular scripted TV program shown to that point, and opened a dialogue, about race and racism that is far from over. It also led, quite quickly, in the early '80s, to the multiculturalism of the squad room in "Hill Street Blues," the hospital in "St. Elsewhere," and, most notably, to the all-black, hugely popular Huxtable family of "The Cosby Show." The made-for-TV movie would also rise up in the '70s; among many other noteworthy efforts, it gave us 1971's "Duel," the TV movie that would launch the film career of a young filmmaker named Steven Spielberg. It was "Jaws" on land, and a perfect audition for the movie Spielberg would craft four years later-- inventing the summer blockbuster and changing Hollywood history in the process. By the end of the decade, things were different indeed. We had the launch of HBO, and the nascent rise of cable television networks, whose original programming and uncensored product would both challenge traditional broadcast television and force another metamorphosis. The result: the landmark NBC drama series "Hill Street Blues," a story whose impact would be felt deep into the '80s. But that's another decade. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

            <descricao>Hillary Clinton used the first major rally of her second run for the White House Saturday to make a populist case for her presidency.</descricao>
            <corpo>New York (CNN)Hillary Clinton used the first major rally of her second run for the White House Saturday to make a populist case for her presidential campaign, declaring that the goal of her presidency would be to tip the nation's economic scales back toward the middle class's favor. Clinton used her gender to cast her candidacy as historic and forward-looking. And she used the story of her mother, Dorothy Rodham, to show that she understands the challenges of climbing out of poverty. RELATED: Read the full transcript of Hillary Clinton's speech "Prosperity can't be just for CEOs and hedge fund managers. Democracy can't be just for billionaires and corporations," she told a crowd of 5,500. "Prosperity and democracy are part of your basic bargain, too. You brought our country back. Now it's time, your time, to secure the gains and move ahead." The rally's geography, on a narrow island in New York City's East River, offered a stirring contrast between the towering Manhattan skyline and working-class Queens. It allowed for nods at both Clinton's experience -- the former secretary of state pointed at the United Nations headquarters, and she represented New York as a senator for eight years -- and at the economic contrast that was the focus of Clinton's speech. Rather than delving into policy specifics, Clinton unveiled a laundry list of issues that her campaign says she'll address in-depth -- one per week -- through August. She touched on a host of Democratic priorities, including increasing the minimum wage, offering paid family leave, implementing equal pay legislation and protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination in the workplace. And she said she plans to push measures that would offer tax benefits to companies that invest in long-term growth in the United States, and penalize those that shelter money overseas. Those issues will be important in a Democratic primary battle where Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who's identified himself as a socialist, now represents Clinton's stiffest challenge. In perhaps Clinton's most emotional portion of the speech, she told the story of her mother, Dorothy Rodham, who was abandoned and working on her own as a housemaid by age 14. She said she once asked her mother what kept her going, and her mother's response was "kindness from someone who believed she mattered." "A first-grade teacher who saw she had nothing to eat at lunch, and without embarrassing her, brought extra food to share. The woman whose house she cleaned letting her go to high school so long as her work got done -- that was a bargain she leapt to accept," Clinton said. "And because some people believed in her, she believed in me." What Clinton didn't address stood out, too. The day after House Democrats rejected the free trade agenda of the current Democratic president, Clinton didn't mention the Trans-Pacific Partnership. While she attacked hedge fund managers, she used the words "Wall Street" just once, despite her proximity to the financial district, and didn't identify bad actors by naming specific people or firms. RELATED: In kicking off campaign, Hillary to emphasize more Rodham, less Clinton Clinton did, though, personalize what she identified as the problems with Washington, and she assigned blame. She hit the Supreme Court, saying the country needs justices "who will protect every citizen's right to vote rather than every corporation's right to buy elections." And she hit Republicans, including the party's presidential field, on issues ranging from gay rights to immigration and voting rights. The GOP, she said, will "trip over themselves promising lower taxes for the wealthy and fewer rules for the biggest corporations, without regard for how that will make income inequality even worse." "Now there may be some new voices in the presidential Republican choir, but they're all singing the same old song: A song called 'Yesterday,'" she said. "You know the one. All our troubles look as though they're here to stay, and we need a place to hide away. They believe in yesterday." The crowd offered Clinton a series of "Hillary, Hillary, Hillary" chants -- particularly when she noted the historic nature of her candidacy and potential nomination. More than she did during her 2008 primary campaign, Clinton used her gender to push back against GOP critiques that she represents the past, not America's future. "I may not be the youngest candidate in this race," she said, "but I will be the youngest woman president in the history of the United States." Clinton followed the line with a joke: "You won't see my hair turn white in the White House. I've been coloring it for years."  The rally marks Clinton's departure from the low-key and carefully choreographed small roundtable events that she's held in the first states to vote in the presidential nominating contest -- Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada -- since announcing her candidacy in April. Supporters began lining up at 6:30 a.m. for a rally that wouldn't begin until four hours later. Media flocked onto the narrow island, with 550 journalists requesting credentials. And Clinton's aides welcomed the attention, billing the rally as the real launch of her campaign -- and of the case she'll make to voters for the next year and a half. RELATED: Hillary Clinton unleashes attack on Wall Street "This will be a new moment. We have had the spring training, now it is opening day," campaign chairman John Podesta told CNN. "I think, for us, this is an opportunity to lay out really the operating manual for where she wants to take the country." The entire day focused on Clinton. Although both Bill and Chelsea Clinton attended -- the first time either appeared at a campaign event -- they did not speak. Some of Clinton's high-profile supporters flocked to the city for Saturday's rally, too. Kasim Reed, mayor of Atlanta, told CNN that he decided to attend the event because he wants to "stand with Secretary Clinton." "I think that people have really been waiting for this aspect of the campaign to begin," Reed said. "There is an enormous amount of pent up energy to get on with the campaign and go on out and make the case to folks why she should be the 45th president." But well-known New York Democratic figures weren't treating Clinton as their party's presumptive nominee. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio didn't attend the rally in his own backyard, saying he's waiting for Clinton to present a "larger vision" for tackling income inequality.  Republicans, looking to seize on the media attention around Clinton's event, bussed supporters north from Washington on Saturday morning, with many leaving at 5:45 a.m. They handed out information about Clinton, including red sunglasses that say "Stop Clinton" and "Shady." GOP presidential contenders, meanwhile, offered pre-buttals before Clinton even took the stage. "Hillary Clinton's re-launch of her campaign doesn't change that her views are out-of-touch with mainstream America," Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said in a statement. "We don't need Washington telling us what to do; we need to build the economy from the ground up with government getting out of the way," he said. "Clinton would be a third term of Obama's failed policies. Instead, we need new, fresh solutions." And the reception from liberal groups afterward noted her reluctance to attack Wall Street by name. "This was mostly a typical Democratic speech -- much better than the direction Republicans offer America, but not the bold economic vision that most Americans want and need," said Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, in a statement that perturbed Clinton staffers at Saturday's event. RELATED: Hillary Clinton channels Roosevelts in first campaign rally Meanwhile, Bill Hyers, a senior strategist for the presidential campaign of former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley -- who has positioned himself as a progressive alternative to the former secretary of state -- called Clinton's platform "status quo thinking." "We need someone who can bring new leadership, strong progressive values, and a record of getting things done to the White House -- and that person is Martin O'Malley," Hyers said in a statement.  The campaign rally was largely organized by Greg Hale, a long-time Clinton aide, who grew up in DeQueen, Arkansas, and met the Clintons when he was young. He started doing advance work for Bill Clinton's 1992 campaign and is the Clintons' go-to person for staging events like Saturday's. The day's 75-minute pre-program was filled with symbolic acts and speakers. A drumline from Brooklyn, where the campaign is headquartered, performed, and Andrea Gonzales, a "Dreamer" from Houston also addressed the audience. As attendees streamed into the rally, music from Clinton's recently-announced Spotify playlist blared from large speakers. The playlist, which is intended to serve as the soundtrack for Clinton's campaign, includes hits like Katy Perry's "Roar" and Pharrell William's "Happy." Hillary Clinton also joined Pericope, a live-streaming phone app, on Saturday. One of her newest campaign hires, famed Olympic skater Michelle Kwan, hosted Clinton's Periscope stream of the event. Hillary Clinton left Roosevelt Island after mingling with the crowd. She heads straight to Iowa for a series of events to organize supporters in early-voting states. Bill Clinton, who will not go to Iowa or any other early state this week with his wife, mingled with the crowd 10 minutes longer. After he shook hands and took pictures with a mother and her young daughter, the mother turned to her child. "That is Hillary Clinton's husband," she said.

            <cabecalho>Dusty Rhodes, wrestling's "American Dream," dies at 69 - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Dusty Rhodes -- the rotund, easy bleeding, easy talking professional wrestler who billed himself as "The American Dream" -- died Thursday, the WWE said.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Dusty Rhodes -- the big, boisterous, bionic elbow-throwing professional wrestler who billed himself as "The American Dream" -- died Thursday, World Wrestling Entertainment said on its website. Rhodes, born Virgil Runnels, was 69. The WWE didn't give a cause or location of Rhodes' death. Rhodes rose to fame as a rotund, easy-bleeding, easy talking-workin' man, a wrestler for the common man. He didn't have the chiseled body some associate with today's wrestlers. He was a good-guy wrestler, often battling heels like Superstar Billy Graham, Blackjack Mulligan, Harley Race and The Four Horsemen, who were led by Ric Flair. "My mentor @WWEDustyRhodes. Much love to your family and more respect than can ever be measured. Love you Dream," Flair tweeted. Rhodes liked to pitch himself as the son of a plumber from Austin, Texas, and an everyman who became the extremely popular champion of the National Wrestling Alliance three times in the 1970s and 1980s. Rhodes told several newspapers that he was digging a ditch in 1974 with a friend of his father's when the man helped him come up with the "American Dream" moniker. The nickname came several years into a career that started slowly. Rhodes told the St. Petersburg Times in 1989 that he grew up going to matches in Austin on Saturday with his father. After playing football in college, he broke into the business in Texas. In his first match he fought Reggie Parks and was paid $15 for a 20-minute match that ended in a draw. "I was glad to get outta there," Rhodes told the Florida paper. "But from then on, I knew, I knew, that's what I wanted to do." He eventually would team with Dick Murdoch in 1968 as the Texas Outlaws, a bad-guy tag team known to cheat their opponents. Back then, there were several wrestling circuits, and Rhodes kept a busy schedule before emerging as a star in Florida for the NWA and eventually World Championship Wrestling. He moved on to the World Wrestling Federation (now the WWE) in the '80s, and wrestled on several other circuits before coming back to the WWE in the mid-2000s. He will be remembered for the spirited and often hilarious in-studio interviews he would give to wrestling commentators to promote upcoming matches. "I have wined and dined with kings and queens, and I've slept in alleys and dined on pork and beans," he once exclaimed. He is also remembered by longtime wrestling fans for the many scars on his forehead, from which he bled profusely during the early days of his career. His former competitors mourned his death. "Today wrestling world lost a great wrestler and unbelievable entertainer. I lost a good friend. RIP Dusty Rhodes," tweeted Ted DiBiase, a former WWE star. "RIP MY BROTHER DUSTY RHODES. GOD BLESS YOU AND YOUR FAMILY FOREVER #RIPDUSTY," wrote the Iron Sheik. Many fans recalled days when their fathers would take them to the arena to see Rhodes, often a star in the main event, or Saturdays when Rhodes was a fixture on television. He was still involved in wrestling working for the WWE in their NXT development program. He was a coach to rising wrestlers and helped book their appearances. Rhodes was inducted into the WWE Hall of Fame in 2007. He has two sons who wrestle professionally as Goldust (Dustin Runnels) and Stardust (Cody Runnels). Dusty Rhodes last appeared on a wrestling broadcast in February unsuccessfully trying to play peacemaker between the two characters.

            <cabecalho>America's homeless doctor brings health care to streets - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Dr. Jim Withers has created a global "street medicine" movement to bring medical care to the homeless.</descricao>
            <corpo>Pittsburgh (CNN)Dr. Jim Withers used to dress like a homeless person. On purpose. Two to three nights a week, he rubbed dirt in his hair and muddied up his jeans and shirt before walking the dark streets of Pittsburgh, searching for the very people he was trying to emulate. Withers wanted to connect with those who had been excluded from his care. "I was actually really shocked how ill people were on the street. It was like going to a third-world country," he said. "Young, old, people with mental illness, runaway kids, women (who) fled domestic violence, veterans. And they all have their own story." Homelessness costs the medical system a lot of money. Individuals often end up in emergency rooms, and stay there longer, because their illnesses go untreated and can lead to complications. For 23 years, Withers has been treating the homeless -- under bridges, in alleys and along riverbanks. "We realized that this was something that could be addressed. We could make 'house calls,' " he said. It's something that Withers' father, a rural doctor, often did. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 Withers' one-man mission became a citywide program called Operation Safety Net. Since 1992, the group has reached more than 10,000 individuals and helped more than 1,200 of them transition into housing. In addition to street rounds, the program has a mobile van, drop-in centers and a primary health clinic, all where the homeless can access medical care. Today, Withers is also fostering a global "street medicine" movement. His nonprofit, the Street Medicine Institute, supports communities in starting programs of their own. Its network includes dozens of teams in the United States and around the world. I recently talked with Withers about his work and his ultimate vision. Below is an edited version of our conversation: CNN: How does it work, doing rounds in homeless camps? Dr. Jim Withers: It can be a challenge to keep up with where the camps are. The homeless are often evicted. Their belongings are taken. And so they have to keep moving. And therefore we have to keep moving to keep up to date on their camps. Doing walking rounds, we try to keep our team down to four people. We don't want to invade (their space) with a lot of people. It's their home. So there's an outreach expert who knows the field and knows the people. There's myself or a medical person, and then we always have a student or two. And we bring a social worker with us. We'll go into the camp, and we make sure they're OK with us coming in. Almost all the homeless are cordial, if not downright really friendly. And we just join them, and they can express what's going on. We always try then to check in with how they're doing medically. If they have insurance, if they have medicines that they should be on that they ran out of. Do they have a doctor? "Did you get that looked at?" What's important to the patient, the person, is our priority. The care that we deliver out there is dependent on what's in our backpacks. We try to emphasize that this is not good enough. Getting (them) into primary care is our goal. READ: Dr. Withers in his own words CNN: What ailments do you see out there? Withers: People on the street, they're exposed to the elements obviously. So you see a lot of things that have to do with the weather and the difficulties of sleeping out there: frostbite, dehydration, hypothermia. But they also have everyday things, like high blood pressure, diabetes, coughs and colds, pneumonia, injuries. We've seen people with cancers. We've seen liver failure, people who needed dialysis that we actually took to dialysis from the street. It goes on and on and on. We've seen almost everything that I've seen clinically and a few things that I hadn't. So it's a very rich environment for medical teaching, unfortunately. CNN: You consider the streets to be a kind of classroom for students. What is their experience? Withers: I see it in the eyes of the students that I take out. They see how many people are living in places that you'd never want to live. The weather, the rain, the cold. I think they also get the chance to see success. When they can see a street person succeed and not just get locked in that hopeless category, their vision changes. The street classroom really ignites, or reignites, what their passion is. They feel like, "Yes, this is what it's about." And they carry that forward. I think the lessons the homeless can teach us about finding the humanity and listening to people are transcendent in all of health care. Our students, I like to think of them as viruses. And we're spreading them out and they're beginning to go to their medical residencies, and they're saying, "Do you have street medicine here?" or "Why aren't you going under bridges?" And so the dialogue is really spreading. CNN: What's your hope for the future? Withers: In the way I'd like to see things, every person who is still on the streets will have medical care that comes directly to them and says, "You matter." And I'd love to see every medical school have a classroom of the streets. I've dedicated myself as much as I can to finding anyone, anywhere, who's interested in doing medical care to their own street people and helping them. Besides just the good that it does and the money that it saves, having street medicine in every community transforms us. We begin to see that we're all in this together. It's something that we should take pride in when we can actually treat people the way we would want to be treated. Want to get involved? Check out Operation Safety Net and the Street Medicine Institute to learn how you can help.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Menswear Dog's star Bodhi has a knack for looking fabulous in just about anything a well-dressed man would wear. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's easy to spot Bodhi walking down New York's Madison Avenue. He has a knack for looking fabulous in just about anything a well-dressed man would wear. His fans know him simply as Menswear Dog. Menswear Dog is the brainchild of a husband and wife team: graphic designer David Fung and fashion expert Yena Kim. One day they decided to put some clothes on their Shiba Inu "for giggles," says Fung, and posted a few photos to Tumblr. "Our blog went viral overnight." Fast forward two years and the Menswear Dog brand has evolved from funny Tumblr posts and Instagram pictures into the book "Menswear Dog Presents: The New Classics." "Our motivation was sheer excitement and curiosity -- excited because there were so many people out there who shared our strange brand of humor, and curious to see what an Internet dog can accomplish in this day and age," the couple said. The book is a guide for guys with little to no fashion sense; it provides insight into the basics of dressing well. If you want to live by the "menswear dogma" outlined in the book, you simply need to abide by a few easy to follow rules: 1. Invest now; save later. 2. Classics are timeless for a reason. 3. Fit trumps price every time. 4. If it doesn't make you feel good, don't wear it. 5. When in doubt, keep it simple. CNN recently met up with the trio at Barneys in New York to find out what Bodhi would wear on a first date. It didn't take long for Kim and Fung to pick out a few outfits (with Bodhi's input, of course). Laid out on the table was a selection of blazers in "special" colors paired with pattered shirts and accessories, including a hat, tie and sunglasses. "The devil's in the details," says Fung, referring to a shirt with a bow tie pasta print. Men, when dressing yourself for a first date, Menswear Dog says you should keep in mind these five tips: 1. Keep it classic. Opt for a crisp white shirt or chambray shirt over a casual tee. 2. When in doubt, wear a sport coat so you can dress up for a night event or drape it on your date's shoulders if she's cold. 3. Don't overdo it with the jewelry; you don't want out-bling your date. 4. A pair of lace-up wingtip oxford shoes wears great with jeans or dress pants. If you want to look more polished, try a pair of double monks. 5. Don't forget to finish off your outfit with a splash of fragrance. Your look doesn't count if you smell like a dog.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>A look inside the 'broken' mind of James Holmes  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Jurors are being taken on a disturbing journey into the thoughts of accused Colorado theater shooter James Holmes.</descricao>
            <corpo>Centennial, Colorado (CNN)It is a rare glimpse into the origins and psyche of a mass shooting. And it is completely unsettling. The capital murder trial of James Eagan Holmes has, for more than a week, been taking a jury inside the "broken" mind of a young man who really didn't like other people. Prosecutors say Holmes should pay with his life for the killings of eight men, three women and a little girl at a Colorado movie theater nearly three years ago. Hours of tape-recorded sessions with a psychiatrist appointed by the court to evaluate his sanity have become part of the evidence as well as a notebook in which Holmes sought to explain his actions. Holmes hasn't taken the witness stand, but he might as well have. His videotaped voice, flat and monotonous, has filled the suburban courtroom here. After weeks of gruesome and emotionally gripping testimony, the focus of Holmes' trial shifted in week six from the carnage to the man prosecutors hold responsible for it -- and to the central questions in this case: What was Holmes' state of mind on July 20, 2012, when he opened fire at the midnight showing of the Batman movie "The Dark Knight Rises" at the Century 16 multiplex in the Denver suburb of Aurora. Was he sane or insane? The jury's answers to these questions could very well determine whether the 27-year-old former grad student is executed or spends the rest of his days in a Colorado prison or mental hospital. Most defendants testify to try to save themselves. But Holmes' words are providing the pillar for the prosecution's case against him. "The mission" is how Holmes referred to the shootings that killed 12 and wounded 70. After 22 hours of sessions, court-appointed psychiatrist William Reid concluded that Holmes was mentally ill but legally sane. He invoked a diagnosis unfamiliar to most laymen: schizotypal personality disorder. In other words, the expert said, Holmes was indeed sick and anti-social, but he was rational. The defendant acknowledged to Reid that shooting people is "legally wrong." "You get punished for killing," Holmes said. He also stated with conviction, "It's wrong to kill children." And yet ... Holmes bought a ticket for "The Dark Knight Rises" and entered Theater 9 around midnight, choosing a front-row seat. He pretended to take a phone call and left through an emergency exit, propping the door open with a plastic doorstop. He returned 18 minutes into the movie, tossing a tear gas grenade into the audience. As panicked moviegoers scrambled for the exits, he fired a 12-gauge pump action shotgun into the seats, then opened fire with an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle with a high-capacity clip that jammed. He also fired several shots with a Glock 40-caliber pistol. The first of 41 calls to 911 came in at about 12:30 a.m., reporting explosions and 10 to 20 shots fired, with people down. The police station is close by, and the first officers arrived about a minute later. They were greeted by a horrific scene: Blood, body tissue and spilled popcorn were everywhere, the air was filled with tear gas and gun smoke, and panicked people were screaming. Cell phones were going off, but nobody was answering them. Ten people lay dead in the theater, and two more were pronounced dead at hospitals. Thirty-three shots found their mark: Four struck 6-year-old Veronica Moser-Sullivan, and six found a 24-year-old aspiring sports journalist, Jessica Ghawi, who had narrowly missed a deadly mass shooting a few weeks earlier at a Toronto food court. James Holmes told psychiatrist he has 'regrets' over theater shootings Holmes told Reid, the court-appointed psychiatrist, that he felt remorse, especially about the little girl's death. "I think it's wrong to kill children," he stated. "I chose to minimize child fatalities by choosing a midnight showing of a PG-13 movie," he explained. "I felt sad that a child had died. It wasn't my intention to kill children or leave them parentless." In Holmes' skewed worldview, each life he took was worth a point, adding value to his own life. If his life had value, he reasoned, he wouldn't have to kill himself. But he said he never wanted to build life points by taking the lives of children. By the end of the movie theater shooting, Holmes believed he had raised his "life capital" to 13, while an ordinary person's would simply be worth a single point. "The dead can't be repaired," he told Reid. "It's kind of irreversible." Instead, he said he absorbed their life experiences as well as their hopes and dreams into his own life. He had accomplished his mission, even if getting arrested was the price he had to pay. But he said he gained nothing from injuring people or leaving them behind to grieve for the dead. He spoke of the 70 people wounded as "collateral damage." Holmes sat down with Reid last summer after entering his insanity plea. The defense has objected to Reid's testimony, saying it violates Holmes' Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. But Judge Carlos Samour has twice turned down defense demands for a mistrial, saying Holmes' attorneys should have raised the issue before Reid took the stand. More insights into Holmes' psyche -- some little more than disjointed ramblings -- are contained in a composition book he mailed to the office of Lynne Fenton, a psychiatrist who was treating him at a campus clinic at the University of Colorado's Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora. He sent the notebook the day before the shootings, seeking to explain how and why he had done it. It was important to him that people understand, Holmes later told Reid. The notebook was found unread in a mail bin and seized by police. It is dedicated to "Goober, Chrissy and Bobbo" -- pet names for his mother, sister and father -- and includes the message, "Love yuhs." One lengthy passage bears the title "Insights into the Mind of Madness." It posits questions about life and death, and contrives a formula under which the two seem to cancel each other out. An odd symbol resembling a combination of an infinity sign and the face of a space alien appears three times in the notebook. Holmes referred to the symbol as "Ultra-ception," explaining the meaning: "Any problem can be solved with death." "What is the meaning of life?" he asks. "What is the meaning of death?" The word "Why?" is written over and over, covering seven pages. But the notebook includes many signs of lucidity as well, demonstrated by Holmes' ability to plan the attack and carry it out. There is a logic, even if it seems warped. His thoughts, however off, hold together, Reid noted. They aren't scattered or disorganized. Holmes rejected using bombs as well as chemical or biological agents as his weapons. They were too complicated. He might blow himself up. He thought about serial killings but ruled them out, again listing his reasons: "too personal, too much evidence, easily caught, few kills." He focused instead on a mass shooting, mostly because he believed he could actually pull it off with "maximum casualties." He rejected carrying out his mission at an airport -- too much security. Instead, he chose a movie theater because it would be crowded and there would be a limited number of exits. He seems to have spent considerable time "casing the place" and sketching detailed maps into the composition book. Holmes faces 166 counts, almost all alleging murder or attempted murder. The murder counts carry a possible death penalty. Holmes had offered to plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence, but Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler rejected any plea deal, stating, "For James Eagan Holmes, justice is death." Prosecutors said they spoke with some 800 shooting survivors and family members of the 12 people slain before deciding to seek the ultimate penalty for Holmes. Holmes pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and the court appointed two psychiatrists to conduct independent evaluations; both concluded he was sane, Brauchler told jurors in his opening statement. In many states, it is left to the defense to prove insanity. But in Colorado, prosecutors bear the burden of proving a suspect sane. They must show that Holmes knew what he was doing was legally and morally wrong. Reid videotaped his sessions with Holmes, some 22 hours in all. Most of the recordings were played last week in court. As the trial's focus shifted in the sixth week of testimony to Holmes, the seating area reserved for shooting survivors and relatives of the dead thinned noticeably. Sandy Phillips, the mother of Jessica Ghawi, said it was difficult to hear Holmes attempt to justify what he has done. "It's excruciatingly painful. He's so devoid of any human kindness, expression, empathy. That's hurtful," she said. "When you're considered collateral damage as a parent who has lost their child in the theater, that's hard to sit and listen to." Her husband, Lonnie, agreed. "It's adding insult to injury when you have to go through this. He decided he wanted to live. He didn't want the pain and misery. He wanted to protect himself, and it's all about him." Voices of Aurora: Coping with grief, conquering life It is disconcerting to see Holmes, dressed in street clothes, sitting stiffly at the defense table under a screen showing him sitting just as stiffly in jailhouse blues. On the screen, he speaks with Reid, who recorded his interviews with Holmes last summer. Holmes speaks in short phrases, volunteering little information. In court, Holmes swivels in his chair but otherwise shows little animation. He parents sit stoically, several rows back. His father, Robert, a mathematician with degrees from Stanford University and the University of California, Berkeley, chews on his fingernails. His mother, Arlene, a nurse, looks straight ahead, occasionally writing in a notebook. James Holmes trial: His parents, changing hair color, medication It's first time the public has heard Holmes talk about the now-infamous mass shooting, one of the worst in recent history. After his arrest, he ended police questioning after eight minutes by asking for a lawyer. To some he comes across as cold, to others he seems completely disconnected. It is unusual for a suspect in a mass killing to survive and go to trial, much less describe an attack in detail. Usually, the suspects die by their own hand or are killed by police, an outcome popularly known as "suicide by cop." But Holmes meekly surrendered to police in the parking lot outside the theater. And so, earlier this week, the jury heard him describe what it was like to walk into a packed movie theater, toss a tear gas grenade into the crowd and open fire. Jurors also heard him explain why he felt he had to do it. The victims had to die, Holmes said, so he wouldn't. He told Reid about gearing up, donning bullet-proof pants, gloves and a gas mask and slinging the AR-15 rifle over his shoulder, tucking the Glock into his belt and picking up his loaded shotgun. He said he couldn't see well in the dark because of the gas mask. As he stepped out of his car outside the theater, he said he called a mental health hotline at the university. It was one last chance to "stop the mission" and back out. But no one picked up the phone. Even if someone had tried to talk him down, Holmes said, he or she likely would have been "overruled." He waited nine seconds and then grew certain that the mission was a go. "It was really going to happen," he said. He felt "calm and collected" as if he was on "autopilot" as he started shooting. He knew he was well-prepared. He doesn't remember hearing gunshots or panicked screams; he had techno music blasting through the ear buds he wore. He didn't view his targets as people. He didn't even know them, he said. They were just "amorphous" numbers, sacrifices to his peculiar point system. Jurors have also learned about Holmes' family and what makes him tick. He has believed since he was a teenager that his mind was "broken." He said he had been obsessed with killing for more than a decade. Brauchler said in his opening statement that Holmes killed to make him feel better about himself after a series of personal setbacks, including failing at school and breaking up with his girlfriend. Holmes wrote in his notebook that he studied neurology in college and grad school in a failed attempt to fix his own "broken mind." His childhood was haunted by night terrors in which "Nail Ghosts" hammered on the walls. Shadows and "flickerings" danced in his peripheral vision. He has been depressed and obsessed with murder since about age 14, he says, because it was the only viable alternative to suicide. No voices commanded Holmes to kill. The idea was completely his own, he told Reid. "I'd say I was on my own authority." He said he considered carrying out the mass shooting at the movie theater since the day he bought the shotgun -- May 28, according to court records. He listed a host of physical maladies -- from schizophrenia to Asperger's to restless leg syndrome -- in a section called "Self-Diagnosis of a Broken Mind." He complained of fatigue, catatonia, insomnia, social awkwardness and isolation, hyperactivity and problems with his eyes, ears, nose -- "constant dripping" -- and even his penis, which he said he injured as a child. He studies himself and his "physical shortcomings" in the mirror obsessively. But perhaps the biggest symptom of his broken brain, he said, was the difficulty he has forming his thoughts into words. He simply cannot communicate, and contact with other human beings makes him very uncomfortable. It feeds his hatred for "humanity." He struggles with an "odd sense of self," waging a constant battle between his "real self" and his "biological self." He noted that he had recently "lost" the battle by allowing himself to fall in love. "So always, that's my mind," he wrote. "It is broken. I tried to fix it. I made it my sole conviction but using something that's broken to fix itself proved insurmountable." He pursued knowledge as a cure, but it didn't work. "Neuroscience seemed like the way to go but it didn't pan out. In order to rehabilitate the broken mind, my soul must be eviscerated. I could not sacrifice my soul to have a 'normal' mind." He said he "fought and fought" until the end. To relieve his personal torture, he sought to escape by distracting himself or ignoring the problem. Still, his depression and low opinion of himself persisted. And so, in the end, he made a choice and noted it in his composition book: "The last escape, mass murder at the movies."

            <cabecalho>New discovery changes strategy to fix sinkhole Corvette - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>When GM restorers were fixing a unique Corvette that fell down a sinkhole, they found autoworkers' signatures underneath nearly every part.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)For Corvette lovers it's sort of like a painter being asked to touch up the "Mona Lisa." Because — like Leonardo da Vinci's painting — there's only one 1 millionth Corvette. Restoring the white, 1992 LT1 convertible roadster doesn't really come with as much pressure as that, said Dave Bolognino with a laugh. "But we don't take it lightly." Bolognino, director of design fabrications operations at General Motors, is helping restore one of eight priceless 'Vettes swallowed by a sinkhole last year at the National Corvette Museum in Bowling Green, Kentucky. The stakes are high, because hard-core 'Vette fans care. They've made it one of the most collected cars in the nation. Globally, the Corvette has become — in GM's words — the "world's longest-running, continuously produced passenger car," since it debuted in 1953. The 1 millionth 'Vette paid homage to that '53 model, because both cars share the same black soft-top, white paint job and red interior color scheme. So far, Bolognino and his colleagues at GM's design facility in Warren, Michigan, have restored about 15-20% of the car. They've got the car running and fixed its structural damage. That's pretty impressive based on disturbing photos GM released last year that showed the car battered and caked with dirt. You could almost hear the Corvette Nation shake its head and whisper, "Good luck with that." When members of the restoration team rolled up their sleeves and took the car apart for the first time last April, they discovered a surprise. Hundreds of them, actually. The surfaces underneath nearly every part were "absolutely covered with signatures," Bolognino said. The GM assembly line workers at the Bowling Green factory who rolled the car out in July of 1992, had signed it. They signed it in virtually every hidden place — under the carpet, under the side panels, under the dash pad. Each signature amounted to a personal salute from hundreds of proud men and women honoring their work and the museum piece they helped create. "We said, 'OK, that changes our strategy,'" said Bolognino. From then on, the team decided to focus even harder on saving every piece of the car — even the most damaged parts. "Somebody took the time to write their name on the undercarriage. We need to take the time to make sure that we straighten that piece of metal instead of replacing it," he said. So, can GM's design experts bring this car back from the dead? They've got to wrestle with some big challenges, including:    Perhaps surprisingly, the total parts lost on the car are relatively few. "The parts we need to replace, you can probably count on two or three hands, maybe," Bolognino said. "The front bumper cover was a total loss. But fortunately there were no signatures on that."  Back at the museum in Bowling Green, officials have asked GM to save any stray original parts that aren't used for the restoration. Those parts will likely end up in an exhibit — or sold as fundraiser items, museum spokeswoman Katie Frassinelli said. "You may see parts of that car on eBay," she joked. "You never know!" The 1 millionth is one of three cars experts said were salvageable from the disaster. Last year GM unveiled a restored 2009 ZR1 Blue Devil that fell victim to the hole. A third car, a 1962 convertible, remains at the museum — its tuxedo black paint job still dusty and dented. The museum intends to restore the '62 on its own. GM says it no longer has the institutional knowledge required to properly put it back in shape. Frassinelli said the museum is hoping to build a restoration and maintenance facility where visitors would be able to watch experts work on the '62 and other aging 'Vettes. Related story: First sinkhole Corvette restored It has been 16 months since the cars got sunk by the sinkhole. And the museum has nearly finished repairing the floor of the 140-foot diameter yellow Skydome, where the ground opened up. The dome's 11-story red spire — a longtime landmark visible along nearby Interstate 65 — has been patched, cleaned and painted, all the way down to its 20-foot-wide base. Engineers say the dome is on track to reopen by early July. Inside the dome, workers have covered the hole with concrete and made the surface safe with a connected grid system of micropiles and concrete beams, Frassinelli said. "If the cave were ever to collapse in the future, the floor's gonna stay put." The museum plans to install an underground camera and lights so visitors can get a look at the hole that did so much damage. Frassinelli credited the sinkhole for an upward trend in museum attendance that continues to rise. The number of visitors so far this year, she said, is tracking higher than the same period last year. The museum is still deciding which cars to display in the dome. A new exterior door and interior display configuration will make it easier to get cars in and out, Frassinelli said. Before the sinkhole, moving cars around inside the Skydome was "kind of like Jenga, or something," she joked. Thanks to the improvements, it will be easier, she said, and the dome will be able to hold a few more cars. The 1 millionth Corvette is expected to be fully restored by Labor Day weekend, September 5-7 — just in time for the museum's 21st anniversary celebration. "We're very confident that we'll get it finished for that," Bolognini said. "We'll make sure the car is right."  </corpo>

            <descricao>In Keyana Tahmaseb's surrealist photo series "Human Canvas," people appear to fade into their surroundings.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Our surroundings in domestic life and daily routines can comfort us, providing stability and consistency amid the chaos of our busy lives. However, surroundings can also trap us, become mundane and make us feel awash in sameness. Keyana Tahmaseb explores the idea of feeling trapped and fading into one's surroundings in her surrealist photo series "Human Canvas." In this series, the subjects literally blend with settings and objects through paint and other materials. Tahmaseb initially took inspiration from Irving Penn's 1949 photo "Girl in Bed," which depicts a woman lying facedown on a bed wearing a night gown that matches the sheets. "I wanted to play with this idea of invisibility and blending in," she said. For her first photo in the series -- No. 3 in the gallery above -- Tahmaseb painted a woman's back to match a rose-printed bedsheet. Tahmaseb said this image was completely inspired by Penn, and from there she let the concept grow, moving to wallpapers, objects and even a lumber mill. The photos hide the subjects' faces, either by looking away from the viewer or being covered. "I feel like without a face, it's more relatable," Tahmaseb said. "You can't exactly tell how old they are or what they look like." Her idea was to enhance the feeling of invisibility, "which is something that's relatable to everyone." Though Tahmaseb's series is not completely free from Photoshop retouching, most of each image was created without digital manipulation. Each photo took between two to six hours to set up and shoot. She wanted to be completely hands-on with this series, including putting together props and sets. She also painted the subjects herself. Tahmaseb describes herself growing up with a paintbrush in one hand and a drawing pencil in the other, spending much of her grade school and college years in art classes. In "Human Canvas," she combines her multimedia background as a photographer and a painter. "I love being able to do all these different things within one project," Tahmaseb said. "I hate saying I'm a photographer sometimes, because I feel like I'm more than that. Painting on people, they become my sculptures." She began this project while studying at the School of Visual Arts in New York. After she began the series by painting her subjects, her classmates challenged her to try using other materials to turn her models into chameleons. This included covering herself with birthday cake in a self-portrait and covering one subject in mud at a lumber mill. With the busyness of patterns and textures in the photos, Tahmaseb keeps things simple stylistically. She uses natural lighting as much as possible, occasionally relying on studio lights if the photo calls for more drama. She also keeps the frame free of anything besides the subjects and their settings. "I wanted you to see most of the body, and I wanted to leave some negative space so that it's not too much with the patterns," she said. "I like my images to look pretty clean and not too suffocating." "Human Canvas" is a window into something that can be felt, but not always explained -- an examination of this trapped feeling through dreamlike images. "I'm creating these little worlds, these little sets. In a way these images are theatrical, even cinematic," Tahmaseb described. "They are a frozen moment in time of the surreal and psychological from this little world." Tahmaseb said that she plans to continue the series, pushing it in new directions through different materials and surroundings. Keyana Tahmaseb is a photographer based in New York.

            <cabecalho>Vince Vaughn and NRA remedy for gun violence: more guns - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Gun lobbyists push for "campus-carry" and "K-12 carry" bills despite statistics showing college presidents, police and students don't want them.</descricao>
            <corpo>John Feinblatt is the president of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun safety advocacy organization. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. (CNN)Hadiya Pendleton was shot and killed in Chicago more than two years ago. June 2 would have been her 18th birthday. Last Tuesday, people all over the country honored Hadiya -- and the more than 30,000 Americans killed with guns every year -- by #WearingOrange as part of the first annual National Gun Violence Awareness Day. The fact that the United States has a gun violence problem isn't up for debate. The question is what we ought to do about it. This is an issue on which people of good faith can and do disagree. But the gun lobby's "guns everywhere" argument -- one that actor Vince Vaughn seems to subscribe to in his new British GQ interview -- isn't the answer. When the National Rifle Association pushes for arming teachers, or forcing schools and colleges to allow guns in their buildings and on their campuses, you have to ask whose interests they really have in mind -- and what problem they think they're solving. We know that college campuses, historically, are incredibly safe places, with homicide rates far below the national average. Administrators and campus police know how to keep schools safe better than NRA headquarters does, and polling reveals campus communities agree. In fact, more than 90% of college presidents and faculty oppose guns on campus, and nearly 90% of police chiefs and about 80% of students don't want guns on campus, either. State lawmakers across the country are rejecting the "guns everywhere" argument as well. In this year alone, legislators have defeated gun lobby-backed "campus-carry" bills in 14 states so far. They have also shot down "K-12 carry" bills in 15 states. Tennessee, Montana and Wyoming -- along with other states with long traditions of hunting and responsible gun ownership -- all have drawn the line when it comes to allowing concealed guns at K-12 schools and forcing colleges to allow guns on campus. The Texas Legislature did pass a "campus-carry" bill May 31, but not the one that NRA lobbyists wanted. That's the silver lining -- the bill includes an important opt-out provision. Private universities won't have to allow guns on campus, and public ones will have the authority to decide where on campus guns are allowed. We've already seen that when a law gives colleges the choice -- roughly half of U.S. states allow schools to set their own policies -- they almost uniformly use their authority to restrict the presence of guns. That's not surprising. After all, colleges have a responsibility to protect their students, as well as an interest in protecting their reputations. If any Texas colleges do go ahead and allow guns in their classrooms, cafeterias and dorms, it'll be interesting to see how those schools fare in recruiting and retaining top faculty -- and whether students and parents will decide to spend their tuition money elsewhere. Balancing individual rights and public safety is what governing is all about. No right is unlimited. That we don't have the right to yell "fire" in a crowded movie theater is the classic example. Of course, the NRA's "guns everywhere" ideology doesn't respect that traditional balance. It even opposes the most effective policies for preventing gun violence, such as background checks for all gun sales and reasonable limits on where people can carry guns. The NRA's leadership looked favorably upon these policies as recently as 1999, but has since renounced them, even though it puts them at odds with the vast majority of the American public. That's why the #WearingOrange campaign trended nationally last week. Americans want common-sense solutions that reduce gun violence. It would serve more lawmakers well to get the message, keep guns out of schools and colleges, and reject the tired ideas we continue to hear from the gun lobby. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

(CNN)I'm recently back from the Marshall Islands -- one of the low-lying Pacific island nations that literally could be wiped off the map by climate change and rising seas. Climate change gets couched, especially by skeptics, as an intangible, far-off issue. But meet people who are terrified their country -- everything they know -- will be drowned beneath the waves, and you can see that this is a crisis, and one that must be addressed immediately. I'll write more soon about my time on the islands -- and about the surprising U.S. community where some Marshallese people already are taking refuge from floods. These are topics, by the way, you voted for me to explore as part of my "2 degrees" series on climate change. For now, here's a look at some of the scariest data about how much ocean levels could rise, and when. We're talking about the future here, so estimates vary by source, but the bottom line is this: Our actions today will create the world future generations will have to inhabit. I hope that's a world that includes the Marshall Islands and Miami, Bangladesh and London. Take a look at these facts, and please let me know what you think in the comments.                But here's the good news: All of these risks are lessened -- or eliminated -- if we stop burning fossil fuels and chopping down carbon-gulping forests. It's possible to address this crisis. There are signs of hope. This week, Germany's Angela Merkel, for example, pressed world leaders to boost their pledges to cut carbon emissions ahead of international negotiations. The so-called "climate chancellor" wants industrialized countries to end fossil fuel use by 2100, according to The Guardian. Future generations will judge our action, or lack thereof, harshly. They'll have every right to do so. Because we will help determine what the coasts -- and the world -- look like for centuries. Email questions to: climate (at) cnn.com.

            <descricao>Pen Farthing, who founded a nonprofit that reunites soldiers with stray dogs and cats they took in during combat, is the 2014 CNN Hero of the Year.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Pen Farthing, who founded a nonprofit that reunites soldiers with stray dogs and cats they took in during combat, is the 2014 CNN Hero of the Year. "There is no stronger bond between man and dog than that formed during war," Farthing said at the annual tribute show, which aired Sunday night on CNN's global networks. The star-studded event, held in New York at the American Museum of Natural History, honored the Top 10 CNN Heroes of 2014 -- everyday people making extraordinary efforts to change the world. Of those 10, CNN's audience voted Farthing as the Hero of the Year. "Wow, I am absolutely at a loss for words," Farthing said as he accepted the award. "This is absolutely amazing. I would really like to thank everybody who voted for the Nowzad charity and what we do in Afghanistan and believing in us. And I would also like to thank all the other heroes in this room for doing what they do to make this world an absolute better place. Thank you guys for doing what you do. Thank you." In addition to the $25,000 that each person receives for making the Top 10, Farthing will be awarded $100,000 for his cause. The inspiration for Nowzad Dogs came in 2006. When Farthing helped break up a dogfight in the town of Nowzad, Afghanistan, the Royal Marine sergeant didn't think much of it. The war-torn town was overrun with dogs. But when one of those dogs followed him back to base, it was hard to tell who rescued whom. "As the troop sergeant, I was there to motivate the guys and get them fired up again to go out and do the job. ... But no one was doing that for me," Farthing said earlier this year. "My time with this dog was a way of de-stressing, collecting my thoughts and popping my head back in the game." After his tour ended, Farthing went through a difficult process to get Nowzad home to Britain. Realizing he wasn't the only one, he soon founded Nowzad Dogs to help other soldiers whose lives were turned around by the animals they befriended. Nowzad Dogs also works to promote animal welfare in Afghanistan. The group's shelter and clinic in Kabul are staffed by 14 Afghan nationals, four of whom are trained veterinarians. The group spays and neuters street dogs and cats and vaccinates them against rabies to reduce the stray animal population. In turn, those efforts help protect residents by having fewer rabid animals roaming the streets. To date, Nowzad Dogs has reunited nearly 700 soldiers with the animals they adopted in Afghanistan. "I know that the dog I looked after was my saving grace from the stress of conflict," Farthing said. "And because of that initial bond, the work goes on: reuniting soldiers with their companions, tackling rabies and training veterinarians in Kabul. I would like to thank everybody for their support. We're making a difference for the Afghan people, the soldiers and one dog and cat at a time." Celebrity presenters at the tribute show this year included actors Benedict Cumberbatch, Christina Hendricks, Taye Diggs, Rosie Perez, Uzo Aduba and John Leguizamo. Also appearing were comedian Kathy Griffin, musician Questlove of The Roots, Kelly Ripa of "Live with Kelly and Michael" and Morgan Spurlock of CNN's "Inside Man." The event included musical performances by Sheryl Crow and Trisha Yearwood. Yearwood performed her latest song, "PrizeFighter," while Crow performed "Wide River to Cross" with CNN Hero Arthur Bloom and his MusiCorps Wounded Warrior Band. Musician Nick Jonas, actor Tyler James Williams and actress Quvenzhane Wallis were also on hand to present awards to remarkable "young wonders" who are doing their part to help change their communities. The stories of this year's Top 10 Heroes, who were nominated by CNN's global audience and profiled earlier this year on CNN, can be found at CNNHeroes.com. Through Amazon Payments, anyone who wants to contribute can make a direct charitable donation to a Hero's designated nonprofit until December 31. Since 2007, the CNN Heroes campaign has profiled more than 200 people on CNN and CNN.com. It has also received more than 50,000 nominations from more than 100 countries. As part of their award package, each of the Top 10 CNN Heroes will also receive organizational training through the Annenberg Foundation, a global supporter of nonprofit organizations. All 10 Heroes will participate in customized versions of the Annenberg Alchemy program, tailored to help grow their individual organizations.  Arthur Bloom Arthur Bloom has used the healing power of music to help hundreds of injured soldiers recover their lives. His program, MusiCorps, pairs professional musicians with troops recovering at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, helping them play instruments and write and record music. "By injecting music into this space, we can inject life," Bloom said. "There's nothing injured about the way they do it. It's just good music."

Since 2006, his nonprofit, Lionsraw, has engaged more than 500 volunteers in construction projects and educational programs that have benefited nearly 6,000 children. "We're trying to harness the passion of football fans to make a difference," he said.

            <descricao>Rick Jones sent employees home from his family's pizza restaurant in Delta, Utah, and carried the garbage out the back door.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Rick Jones sent the employees home from his family's pizza restaurant and carried the garbage out the back door. "I thought it was strange that I didn't hear it close," he said. "I was knocked out and then suddenly someone was forcing my legs and hands down and trying to get me to drink bleach." Jones, 21, woke up a few hours later in the hospital with a concussion, serious bruises and a message of hate carved into the inside part of his arms. "On one arm it said 'die' and on the other arm it said 'f*g'," he said. Unfortunately, he'd see those words again in coming weeks. The assault was the first in a series of crimes committed against Jones, a lifelong resident of Delta, a town of about 3,500 people in western Utah.  Lt. Gov. Spencer J. Cox issued a statement on Friday about the "hate crime investigation." "I was horrified and heart-broken to learn of this cowardly and barbaric assault," Cox said. "The Jones family is an upstanding, well-respected and beloved part of the Delta community. ... This will not stand." "In all of my years I can't remember anything like this ever happening before, so it's something we want to get a handle on as soon as we can," Millard County Sheriff Robert Dekker told CNN affiliate KSL. The criminals did more than hurt Jones that night. They took $1,300 from the restaurant he owns with his three sisters, Grand Central Pizzeria and Grill. Then the crimes started to hit home. Literally. The following day, somebody went to the home in Delta where Jones lives with his parents and sisters and spray-painted the same malicious words onto the garage door. More than a month passed.  On June 10, Jones woke up to the sound of a crash. Somebody had thrown a Molotov cocktail through his bedroom window. "It didn't explode but it started a fire that burnt the wall and some of my carpet," he said. "It actually landed on my bed. I ran and warned my family 'there is a fire' and I got a fire extinguisher and was able to quickly get the fire out." Also thrown through the window was a rock that "had some writing on it that referenced homosexuality," Dekker told KSL. That same night the pizza restaurant was robbed again, police said. The thieves took $1,800 and vandalized the business, Jones said. "They painted the words, 'You'll burn' and 'die f*g' on the walls," he said.  Terri Jones, his mother, said the community has been supportive and the family is standing strong. "When you attack any member of our family, you attack everybody here. This is not just against my son, it is against every single one of us," she told KSL. "We're not going to back down, we're not going to close the restaurant if we can keep from it. We're not going to move from Delta, we're not going to be afraid. ..." Rick Jones told CNN he's left wondering who wants to hurt him. "I've lived here my whole live with my family," Jones said. "Nothing like this has ever happened to me before. I don't have any known enemies, but obviously I have one somewhere."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>NASA 'flying saucer' parachute fails - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>A parachute fails as NASA tests a craft shaped like a flying saucer that could hold the key to a future human mission to Mars.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)NASA's "flying saucer" took to the skies without trouble Monday, but one of the main technologies it was testing -- a parachute meant to help future craft land on Mars -- didn't work as planned. A giant supersonic parachute meant to slow the saucer-shaped Low-Density Supersonic Decelerator's descent to the Pacific Ocean -- one of two braking technologies that the craft was testing Monday -- deployed but failed to inflate. The craft safely splashed down into the ocean off the Hawaiian Island of Kauai, but the failure of the Supersonic Ringsail parachute to inflate will be a disappointment for NASA. "We'll study data from this test to learn &amp; improve," NASA said in a tweet. This is the second parachute hitch for the LDSD; a parachute also failed to inflate when the craft was tested for the first time last year. NASA has used parachutes to safely put landers on Mars going back to the 1970s, but it is developing and testing new parachutes and other devices to handle the landings of larger craft, including potentially those with astronauts. Monday's test began with an enormous balloon lifting the LDSD into the sky from the U.S. Navy's Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai. There were cheers in the control room as the balloon began lifting the vessel, but the joy was short lived. Once the balloon reached the target height of 120,000 feet, more than 20 miles (32 kilometers) above Earth, mission controllers set the LDSD free to fire its rockets to go higher -- 180,000 feet -- before letting it descend. On its descent, the first test braking technology worked, NASA said. The supersonic inflatable aerodynamic decelerator -- a balloonlike vessel -- inflated around the craft, creating drag and slowing the saucer from Mach 3 to roughly Mach 2.4. The parachute did not work out as well.  NASA says the Supersonic Ringsail parachute is the largest supersonic parachute ever tested for landing on Mars. Current technology for the task -- decelerating from high speeds during re-entry into the atmosphere, to the final stages of landing on Mars -- dates back to NASA's Viking Program, which put two landers on the Martian surface in 1976. The basic Viking parachute design has been used ever since. It was successfully used again in 2012 to deliver the rover Curiosity to Mars. NASA will need new and improved landing technologies to handle the larger spaceships of tomorrow and land them on rocky surfaces, as well as at higher elevations.  NASA scientists hope this saucer-shaped craft could be the key. "As NASA plans ambitious robotic science missions to Mars, laying the groundwork for even more complex human expeditions to come, the spacecraft needed to land safely on the Red Planet's surface will become larger and heavier in order to accommodate explorers' extended stays on the Martian surface," the agency's website said. This means the supersonic parachute will have to create sufficient atmospheric drag to slow the vehicles down so they can be landed safely. Using drag for deceleration means precious fuel can be saved for landing maneuvers. A third test flight for the LDSD is scheduled for summer 2016. CNN's Mariano Castillo, Lauriel Cleveland and Amanda Barnett contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <descricao>View the Avian Flu Fast Facts on CNN and learn about bird flu symptoms and how bird flu spreads to humans. Typically this illness affects only birds. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Here's a look at avian flu. Avian influenza, also called avian flu or bird flu, is an illness that usually affects only birds. A new strain jumped to baby seals in 2011. While there have been deaths from certain strains of avian flu, person-to-person infections are rare. The official name for the most commonly seen and most deadly form of the virus is called "Influenza A (H5N1)," or the "H5N1 virus." In March 2013, a strain of bird flu previously not seen in humans - H7N9 - was detected in China. People have killed hundreds of millions of birds around the world in an attempt to control the spread of the avian flu. There are many different strains of avian flu: 16 H subtypes and 9 N subtypes. Only those labeled H5, H7 and H10 have caused deaths in humans. Diagnosis/Treatment: Most cases of human bird flu infections are due to contact with infected poultry or surfaces that are contaminated with infected bird excretions: saliva, nasal secretions and feces. Symptoms of avian flu include fever, cough, sore throat and sometimes severe respiratory diseases and pneumonia. The FDA has approved four drugs to combat influenza - amantadine, rimantadine, oseltamivir (brand name: Tamiflu) and zanamivir (brand name: Relenza). H5N1 is resistant to two of the FDA approved drugs used to combat influenza - amantadine and rimantadine. The mortality rate is nearly 60% for infected humans. Confirmed human cases of avian flu (H5N1 strain) since December 26, 2003: Azerbaijan - 8 cases, 5 deaths Bangladesh - 7 cases, 1 death Cambodia - 56 cases, 37 deaths Canada - 1 case, 1 death China - 51 cases, 31 deaths Djibouti - 1 cases, 0 deaths Egypt - 329 cases, 107 deaths Indonesia - 199 cases, 167 deaths Iraq - 3 cases, 2 deaths Laos - 2 cases, 2 deaths Myanmar - 1 case, 0 deaths Nigeria - 1 case, 1 death Pakistan - 3 cases, 1 death Thailand - 25 cases, 17 deaths Turkey - 12 cases, 4 deaths Vietnam - 127 cases, 64 deaths Total - 826 cases, 440 deaths Timeline: Early 1900s -The avian flu is first identified in Italy. 1961 - The H5N1 strain is first isolated in birds in South Africa. December 1983 - Chickens in Pennsylvania and Virginia are exposed to the avian flu, and more than five million birds are killed to stop the disease from spreading. May 1997 - Eighteen people are infected by the H5N1 strain in Hong Kong, and six die. These are the first documented cases of human infection. Hong Kong destroys its entire poultry population (1.5 million birds) in three days. 1999 - Two children in Hong Kong are infected by the H9N2 strain. February 2003 - Eighty-four people in the Netherlands are affected by the H7N7 strain of the virus, and one dies. January 25, 2004 - China bans imports of Thai chicken products. Nine million chickens are slaughtered in Thailand in an effort to stop the spread of the disease. February 2, 2004 - The World Health Organization is investigating possible human-to-human transmission among a family in Vietnam. Three family members have died of the illness, and one has recovered. One member had no contact with infected poultry while the others did. February 7, 2004 - 12,000 chickens are slaughtered in Kent County, Delaware, after they are found to be infected with an H7 virus. February 23, 2004 - A flock of 6,600 broiler chickens in Gonzalez County, Texas, is destroyed after being diagnosed with an "extremely infectious and fatal" form of bird flu, the H5N2 strain. February 5, 2005 - The Cambodian Health Ministry and WHO confirm the first human death in Cambodia (the H1N1 strain, on January 30). October 7, 2005 - The avian flu reaches Europe. Romanian officials quarantine a village of about 30 people after three dead ducks there test positive for bird flu. November 12, 2005 - A one-year-old boy in Thailand tests positive for the lethal H5N1 strain of avian influenza. November 16, 2005 - WHO confirms two human cases of bird flu in China, including a female poultry worker who died from the H5N1 strain. November 17, 2005 - Two deaths are confirmed in Indonesia from the H5N1 strain of avian influenza. January 1, 2006 - A Turkish teenager dies of the H5N1 strain of avian influenza in Istanbul, and later that week, two of his sisters follow. January 17, 2006 - A 15-year-old girl from northern Iraq dies after contracting bird flu. February 20, 2006 - The French Health Ministry confirms that a duck in central France had the H5N1 strain of avian flu. February 20, 2006 - Vietnam becomes the first country to successfully contain the disease. A country is considered disease-free when no new cases are reported in 21 days. March 12, 2006 - Officials in Cameroon confirm cases of the H5N1 strain. The avian flu has now reached four African countries. March 13, 2006 - The avian flu is confirmed by officials in Myanmar (Burma). May 11, 2006 - Djibouti announces its first cases of H5N1 - several birds and one human. December 20, 2011 - The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services releases a statement saying that the government is urging scientific journals to omit details from research they intend to publish on the transfer of H5N1 among mammals. There is concern that the information could be misused by terrorists. July 31, 2012 - Scientists announce that H3N8, a new strain of avian flu, caused the death of more than 160 baby seals in New England in 2011. March 2013 - The official Chinese news agency Xinhua reports that two people in China have died after falling ill with a strain of bird flu, H7N9, not detected before in humans. December 2, 2013 - A woman in Hong Kong is hospitalized with H7N9 after coming in contact with live poultry in the mainland China city of Shenshen. December 6, 2013 - A 73-year-old woman infected with H10N8 dies in China, the first human fatality from this strain. January 8, 2014 - Canadian health officials confirm that a resident from Alberta has died from H5N1 avian flu, the first case of the virus in North America. It is also the first case of H5N1 infection ever imported by a traveler into a country where the virus is not present in poultry. March 3, 2015 - A WHO report indicates that so far there have been 602 laboratory-confirmed cases of H7N9, including 227 deaths. April 20, 2015 - Officials say more than 5 million hens will be euthanized after bird flu was detected at a commercial laying facility in northwest Iowa. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, close to 8 million cases of bird flu have been detected in 13 states since December. Health officials say there is little to no risk for transmission to humans with respect to H5N2. No human infections with the virus have ever been detected.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Joyce Mitchell: New York prison worker charged  - CNN.com</cabecalho>

            <corpo>(CNN)Prison worker Joyce Mitchell is in custody, accused of aiding in a daring prison escape. The two convicted killers she allegedly helped are free, but on the run. Mitchell allegedly provided Richard Matt and David Sweat with the tools to cut through cell walls for their escape from an upstate New York prison a week ago. "The defendant did intentionally ... and unlawfully introduce hacksaw blades, chisels, a punch and a screwdriver bit, dangerous contraband, into Clinton Correctional Facility," court records said. Mitchell allegedly brought the items to the prison on May 1. She was arraigned Friday night on a felony charge of promoting prison contraband and a misdemeanor charge of criminal facilitation. She pleaded not guilty. If convicted, she faces up to eight years behind bars.  Matt and Sweat's escape was discovered during an early morning bed check at Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora. While making their escape, they slipped through holes and cut into a steel plate and a steam pipe, then got out through a manhole and onto the street. And Mitchell had a lot to do with their ability to plan out the daring escape, authorities said. She supplied tools used in the escape and was their possible getaway driver before she got cold feet, authorities said. Her cell phone was also used to make calls to people connected to Matt, according to a source. It's not known who made these calls. Mitchell has told investigators that Matt made her feel "special" though she didn't say she was in love with him, a source familiar with the investigation said. Her husband and prison co-worker, Lyle Mitchell, is also under investigation, but has not been arrested or charged, authorities said. He worked in the maintenance department at the tailoring block where his spouse was employed, Clinton County District Attorney Andrew Wylie said. Lyle Mitchell has worked at the prison since 2005, most recently as an industrial training supervisor, the same title his wife held. Lyle Mitchell cried when allegations surfaced against his wife, according to a friend who did not want to be named. The friend said Lyle Mitchell asked how his wife could do such a thing. Infamous manhunts: When police have tracked fugitives into the wild  Joyce Mitchell provided hacksaw blades, drill bits and lighted eyeglasses to the convicts before their escape, sources said. The hacksaw blades and other items given to Matt were purchased over the past few months, according to law enforcement sources. Matt and Sweat used power tools to cut through cell walls. Despite the time, effort and noise likely involved, authorities didn't learn anything was amiss until a bed check at 5:30 a.m. Saturday. Authorities believe the fugitives are continuing their escape as a pair. Towns under virtual lockdown  State Department of Corrections officials had received a complaint about the relationship between Joyce Mitchell and one of the two escapees. The department didn't find enough evidence to support the complaint, though that does not mean the inmate and prison worker weren't close. "I don't believe that the information was that there was absolutely no relationship," said Wylie, the district attorney. Mitchell's next court appearance is Monday. On Saturday, she was transferred from the Clinton County Jail about 150 miles south to the Rensselaer County Correctional Facility. The move was meant to avoid the distraction of jailing her near the massive manhunt, Clinton County Sheriff David Favro said.  More than 800 state, local and federal law enforcement officers are searching for the escapees, New York State Police said. They have been following more than 700 leads developed in the weeklong manhunt. Tracking dogs picked up the scent of both prisoners at a gas station and followed it east toward the town of Cadyville, Wylie said. The gas station has a Subway sandwich shop, and the two might have been rummaging for food in the trash bin, authorities said. "It could have been something that occurred earlier in the week," the district attorney said Friday of when the scent was left. "But we're hoping that it was two nights ago, and they're closing in on the two men right now." Sweat was serving a life sentence with no chance of parole in the murder of a Broome County sheriff's deputy in 2002, and Matt was sentenced to 25 years to life in the kidnapping and murder of a man in 1997. As the woman who allegedly helped them escape sits in jail on bail, the search for the convicts has been going on since June 6. CNN's Ray Sanchez, Linh Tran, Miguel Marquez, Dominique Dodley, Greg Botelho and Steve Almasy contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Here's a look at oil spill disasters. Spill estimates vary by source. Ten Largest Oil Spills: 1. January 1991 - During the Gulf War, Iraqi forces intentionally release 252-336 million gallons of oil into the Persian Gulf. 2. April 20, 2010 - An explosion occurs on board the BP-contracted Transocean Ltd. Deepwater Horizon oil rig, spilling approximately 210 million gallons of oil in the Gulf of Mexico. 3. June 3, 1979 - Ixtoc 1, an exploratory well, blows out, spilling 140 million gallons of oil into the Bay of Campeche off the coast of Mexico. 4. March 2, 1992 - A Fergana Valley oil well in Uzbekistan blows out, spilling 88 million gallons of oil. 5. February 1983 - An oil well in the Nowruz Oil Field in Iran begins spilling oil. One month later, an Iraqi air attack increases the amount of oil spilled to approximately 80 million gallons of oil. 6. August 6, 1983 - The Castillo de Bellver, a Spanish tanker, catches fire near Cape Town, South Africa, spilling more than 78 million gallons of oil. 7. March 16, 1978 - The Amoco Cadiz tanker runs aground near Portsall, France, spilling more than 68 million gallons of oil. 8. November 10, 1988 - The tanker Odyssey breaks apart during a storm, spilling 43.1 million gallons of oil northeast of Newfoundland, Canada. 9. July 19, 1979 - The Atlantic Empress and the Aegean Captain tankers collide near Trinidad and Tobago. The Atlantic Empress spills 42.7 million gallons of oil. On August 2, the Atlantic Empress spills an additional 41.5 million gallons near Barbados while being towed away. 10. August 1, 1980 - Production Well D-103 blows out, spilling 42 million gallons of oil southeast of Tripoli, Libya. Notable U.S. Oil Spills: Union Oil Company January 28, 1969 - Inadequate casing led to the blowout of an Union Oil oil well 3,500 feet deep about five miles off the coast of Santa Barbara, California. About 3 million gallons of oil gushed from the leak until it could be sealed 11 days later, covering 800 square miles of ocean and 35 miles of coastline and killing thousands of birds, fish and other wildlife. The disaster is largely considered to be one of the main impetuses behind the environmental movement and stricter government regulation, including President Richard Nixon's signing of the National Environmental Policy Act, the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency in 1970. It also inspired Wisconsin Senator Gaylord Nelson to found the first Earth Day. Exxon Valdez March 24, 1989 - The Exxon Valdez runs aground on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound, Alaska, spilling more than 11 million gallons of oil. March 22, 1990 - Captain Joseph Hazelwood is acquitted of all but one misdemeanor, negligent discharge of oil. Hazelwood is later sentenced to 1,000 hours of cleaning around Prince William Sound and is fined $50,000. July 25, 1990 - At an administrative hearing, the Coast Guard dismisses charges of misconduct and intoxication against Captain Joseph Hazelwood, but suspends his captain's license. October 8, 1991 - A federal judge approves a settlement in which Exxon and its shipping subsidiary will pay $900 million in civil payments and $125 million in fines and restitution. Exxon says it has already spent more than $2 billion on cleanup. September 16, 1994 - A federal jury orders Exxon to pay $5 billion in punitive damages to fishermen, businesses and property owners affected by the oil spill. November 7, 2001 - The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rules that the $5 billion award for punitive damages is excessive and must be cut. December 6, 2002 - U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland reduces the award to $4 billion. December 22, 2006 - The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reduces the award to $2.5 billion. June 25, 2008 - The U.S. Supreme Court cuts the $2.5 billion punitive damages award to $507.5 million. June 15, 2009 - The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals orders Exxon to pay $470 million in interest on the $507.5 million award. BP Gulf Oil Spill April 20, 2010 - An explosion occurs aboard BP contracted Transocean Ltd Deepwater Horizon oil rig stationed in the Gulf of Mexico. Of the 126 workers aboard the oil rig, 11 are killed. April 22, 2010 - The Deepwater Horizon oil rig sinks. An oil slick appears in the water. It is not known if the leak is from the rig or from the underwater well to which it was connected. April 24, 2010 - The U.S. Coast Guard reports that the underwater well is leaking an estimated 42,000 gallons of oil a day. April 28, 2010 - The Coast Guard increases its spill estimate to 210,000 gallons of oil a day. May 2, 2010 - President Barack Obama tours oil spill affected areas and surveys efforts to contain the spill. May 4, 2010 - The edges of the oil slick reach the Louisiana shore. May 26, 2010 - BP starts a procedure known as "top kill," which attempts to pump enough mud down into the well to eliminate the upward pressure from the oil and clear the way for a cement cap to be put into place. The attempt fails. June 16, 2010 - BP agrees to create a $20 billion fund to help victims affected by the oil spill. July 5, 2010 - Authorities report that tar balls linked to the oil spill have reached the shores of Texas. July 10, 2010 - BP removes an old containment cap from the well so a new one can be installed. While the cap is removed, oil flows freely. The new cap is finished being installed on July 12. July 15, 2010 - According to BP, oil has stopped flowing into the Gulf. August 3, 2010 - BP begins the operation "static kill" to permanently seal the oil well. August 5, 2010 - BP finishes the "static kill" procedure. Retired Adm. Thad Allen says this will "virtually assure us there's no chance of oil leaking into the environment." January 11, 2011 - The National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling releases their full report stating that the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig launched the worst oil spill in U.S. history, 210 million gallons. September 14, 2011 - The final federal report is issued on the Gulf oil spill. It names BP, Transocean and Halliburton as sharing responsibility for the deadly explosion that resulted in the April 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. January 26, 2012 - A federal judge in New Orleans rules that Transocean, the owner of the Deepwater Horizon rig, is not liable for compensatory damages sought by third parties. January 31, 2012 - A federal judge in New Orleans rules that Halliburton is not liable for some of the compensatory damages sought by third parties. March 2, 2012 - BP announces it has reached a settlement with attorneys representing thousands of businesses and individuals affected by the 2010 oil spill. April 18, 2012 - Court documents are filed revealing the March 2, 2010 settlement BP reached with attorneys representing thousands of businesses and individuals affected by the oil spill. A federal judge must give preliminary approval of the pact, which BP estimates will total about $7.8 billion. April 24, 2012 - The first criminal charges are filed in connection with the oil spill. Kurt Mix, a former engineer for BP, is charged with destroying 200-plus text messages about oil spill, including one concluding that the undersea gusher was far worse than reported at the time. November 15, 2012 - Attorney General Eric Holder announces that BP will plead guilty to manslaughter charges related to the rig explosion and will pay $4.5 billion in government penalties. Separate from the corporate manslaughter charges, a federal grand jury returns an indictment charging the two highest-ranking BP supervisors on board the Deepwater Horizon on the day of the explosion with 23 criminal counts. November 28, 2012 - The U.S. government issues a temporary ban barring BP from bidding on new federal contracts. The ban is lifted on March 13, 2014. December 21, 2012 - U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier signs off on the settlement between BP and businesses and individuals affected by the oil spill. January 3, 2013 - The Justice Department announces that Transocean Deepwater Inc. has agreed to plead guilty to a violation of the Clean Water Act and pay $1.4 billion in fines. February 25, 2013 - The trial to determine how much BP owes in civil damages under the Clean Water Act begins. The first phase of the trial will focus on the cause of the blowout. September 19, 2013 - In federal court in New Orleans, Halliburton pleads guilty to destroying test results that investigators had sought as evidence. The company is given the maximum fine of $200,000 on the charge. September 30, 2013 - The second phase of the civil trial over the oil spill begins. This part focuses on how much oil was spilled and if BP was negligent because of its lack of preparedness. December 18, 2013 - Kurt Mix, a former engineer for BP, is convicted of destroying evidence for deleting text messages about the oil spill. September 4, 2014 - A federal judge in Louisiana finds that BP was "grossly negligent" in the run-up to the 2010 disaster, which could quadruple the penalties it would have to pay under the Clean Water Act to more than $18 billion. Judge Carl Barbier of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana also apportions blame for the spill, with "reckless" BP getting two thirds of it. He says the other two main defendants in the more than 3,000 lawsuits filed in the spill's wake, Transocean and Halliburton, were found to be "negligent." January 20-February 2, 2015 - The final phase of the trial to determine BP's fines takes place. The ruling is expected in a few months.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Police officers fired 12 rounds during a deadly shootout last month at a restaurant in Waco, Texas, authorities said Friday in a news release. Waco police said 44 shell casings have been recovered from the scene where nine bikers were killed during a shootout at a Twin Peaks restaurant. Twelve of those casings came from the .223 caliber rifles of three SWAT officers, who were in adjacent parking lots. Police couldn't say whether any of those bullets killed or wounded any bikers. Other agencies are doing autopsies and ballistic analysis, Waco police said. The three officers, who had their weapons set to semiautomatic mode, are on administrative duty as the investigation into the incident continues. Police said they have not yet recovered casings that remained in revolvers used during the shootings. After the May 17 shooting, 177 people were arrested and held in jail on $1 million bail each. Capt. John Kolinek of the McLennan County Sheriff's Office said Friday that 62 remain in jail. Authorities also updated the number of weapons recovered at the scene. At least 475 were found, including 139 handguns and 12 long guns. Police also recovered an ax, bats, batons, brass knuckles, a chain, clubs, a hatchet, knives, a machete, pepper spray, a pipe, stun guns, tomahawks and weighted weapons.

            <descricao>A planned getaway ride may have fallen flat, leaving jail breakers Richard Matt and David Sweat stranded and hurled into an arduous survival game.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)A planned getaway ride may have fallen flat, leaving jail breakers Richard Matt and David Sweat stranded in upstate New York and hurled into an arduous game of survival. Like other fugitives before them, the convicted killers will need backwoods skills and perhaps crime to get by, while they run from hundreds of officers hunting them from planes, cars, boats and on foot over a hazardous landscape. The desperation to stay alive and keep their freedom can make dangerous men even more lethal, especially if they manage to get their hands on guns. For years, fugitives have sought refuge in the wild, where they have ambushed officers and eluded them for days, weeks, even years on some of America's most notorious manhunts:  Wanted for Matt and Sweat are convicted killers. Matt held a man hostage, and when ransom money didn't come across, he broke the victim's neck and dismembered his body. Sweat shot a deputy to death then ran over him. Law enforcement wants them back behind bars to serve out their sentences. The hunt Hollywood couldn't have written a jail break like theirs from Dannemora's maximum security prison. With power tools, they cut through a cell wall that included a steel plate, maneuvered across a catwalk, shimmied down six stories to a tunnel of pipes, followed that tunnel, broke through a double-brick wall, cut into a 24-inch steam pipe, climbed through the steam pipe, cut another hole so they could get out of the pipe and finally surfaced through a manhole. But it seems a possible accomplice, a getaway driver, backed out of picking them up and went to the hospital with panic attacks. Authorities fear Matt and Sweat may have crossed into Vermont; the state has joined the manhunt and will allow New York State law enforcement to cross the state line to chase them, if they have to. How it ended It hasn't yet. Early Thursday, they were still on the lam. That's odd for New York State prison breaks. Authorities usually round up escaped prisoners within little more than a day. Though their jail break illustrates their cunning and skill, Matt and Sweat are not known to be trained survivalists. Other fugitives who were have led brigades of officers on weeks-long chases.  Frein did have survivalist skills from his apparent experiences in war. It took police seven weeks to track him down in rural Pennsylvania in October last year. His alleged crimes and the manhunt landed him on the FBI Top Ten Fugitives list. Wanted for Frein was notorious for hating law enforcement and allegedly shot to death Pennsylvania State Police Cpl. Bryon Dickson and wounded Trooper Alex Douglas last year. The hunt The survivalist, who was 31 at the time, claimed to have fought in wars in Serbia and Africa and was a trained marksman. It appeared he had the troopers' blood fresh on his hands, when he led dozens of law officers traipsing through forest and field. Frein belonged to a simulation group that re-enacted Cold War-era European conflicts with non-lethal Airsoft guns. But authorities believed he had turned that activity lethal. He was later found carrying a rifle and a pistol. How it ended U.S. Marshal's Service special operations officers found Frein at an abandoned airport in Tannersville. He didn't put up a fight. In an arraignment in January this year, Frein pleaded not guilty in the shooting of the troopers.  Dorner was professionally trained in the Navy's counterinsurgency program and as a police officer, making him one of the most dangerously skilled fugitives in recent times. Wanted for He went on a killing rampage in 2013. After legal moves to reverse his 2009 firing from the Los Angeles Police Department failed, Dorner threatened to exact bloody revenge on the LAPD by waging guerrilla warfare. He started by killing loved ones of someone involved in his case on February 3, 2013. Then police picked up pursuit. The hunt As he eluded them into the San Bernardino Mountains, Dorner kept on killing. Officers scoured the winter landscape on snowcats and in armored vehicles for days, searching some 200 vacant cabins. They trudged through knee-high snow with rifles. Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa announced a $1 million reward for information leading to Dorner's arrest and conviction. How it ended Nine days after his first double-murder, California Fish and Wildlife wardens spotted Dorner in a car and gave chase. He crashed then carjacked a pickup truck. He fled to a cabin, where he got into a shootout with sheriff's deputies, killing one and wounding another. Police tossed smoke devices inside the cabin, which caught fire and burned for hours. They later found a charred body there. Authorities believe Dorner, who was 33, took his own life. On his rampage, he killed four people -- the daughter of his police union representative, her fiancé, a police officer in suburban Riverside and a sheriff's deputy.  The reclusive outdoors enthusiast set the bomb that killed two people at Atlanta's Centennial Olympic Park during the 1996 Summer Olympic Games. He, too, landed on the FBI's most wanted list. Wanted for In addition to that attack, Rudolph was wanted for the bombings in the late 1990s of two abortion clinics, one in Atlanta and one in Birmingham, Alabama. And he bombed an Atlanta nightclub popular with lesbians. One person died and 12 more were injured in those attacks. In the case of the Birmingham attack, Rudolph later admitted he detonated the bomb by remote control, while Robert Sanderson, a 35-year-old off-duty police officer working as a security guard, was standing over it. Sanderson died. The hunt Law enforcement agencies begin looking for Rudolph in 1998, after witnesses reported seeing his gray 1989 Nissan pickup near the Birmingham clinic before the blast. He successfully eluded them -- for five years. Hundreds of law enforcement officers conducted a door-to-door search and combed woods in North Carolina. The dense foliage made a helicopter with infrared sensors capable of detecting signs of life on the ground useless. Rudolph hid well in the woods he knew well. To protest what he felt was the persecution of his brother by the FBI and the media, Daniel Rudolph set up a camera in his Summerville, South Carolina, garage and cut off his hand with a circular saw. It was later surgically reattached. How it ended On May 31, 2003, rookie Police Officer Jeff Postell, 21 at the time, thought he saw someone trying to break into a building in Murphy, North Carolina. When he confronted the man, he fled, but Postell caught up with him. The suspect was compliant. He had no ID, but told Postell who he was -- Eric Rudolph. After a series of guilty pleas, Rudolph was sentenced to a total of 120 years in prison. In 2005, he apologized to his victims and their families for his 1996 bombing of Centennial Olympic Park. But he did not apologize to the victims of his other attacks. Rudolph is currently incarcerated at the Supermax prison in Florence, Colorado.

            <cabecalho>McKinney pool party incident was about race - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>You can tell a story, "Rashomon"-style, that the officer would have behaved the same with a white group of white teens, but you'd be delusional.</descricao>
            <corpo>Dorothy A. Brown is a professor of law at Emory University and author of "Critical Race Theory: Cases, Materials, and Problems." The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)The McKinney, Texas, swimming pool incident, which blew up into a national news story via a seven-minute video shot by a witness, reminds me of the movie "Rashomon," where a single event is told from varying and conflicting perspectives. In one telling of the McKinney story, Officer Eric Casebolt pulls a 14-year-old bikini-clad girl to the ground and kneels on her back to restrain her, maybe raising some concern, but he was justified under the circumstances. Viewers and other witnesses who took away that version of the story from the video-taped incident say this has nothing to do with race, even though it was a white police officer and everyone being "policed" was black. One woman interviewed by CNN said about Casebolt: "I think he deserves a medal for what he did." She supports his drawing his weapon on the teenagers because "he was being attacked from behind." Besides, goes this version of the story, there was a mob of teenagers who did not leave when the officer asked them to, but defiantly stood there watching and filming. If there weren't so many of them and if they had listened to Casebolt, who was just doing his job of protecting the community, then none of this would have happened. In other words, the mob's behavior was the root cause of this mess. Another view of the incident and the video? A white, out-of-control police officer sees a group of black teenagers, thinks "thugs" and responds accordingly. They see Casebolt yelling at the top of his lungs and cursing at children. Yes, children. This was no mob; this was a group of teens hanging out together having some harmless fun at the pool. Most of the kids were polite. They said "sir" when speaking to the police. Yet Casebolt appeared angry beyond belief, yelling at children about his having to run in the hot sun. Instead of de-escalating the situation, he made things worse. When the 14-year-old was sitting on the ground, he told her "on your face." In this version of the story, a grown man picks up a child and pushes her on the ground facedown. She is thoroughly subdued, but he continues to kneel on her back. Viewers see the officer purposely humiliating a 14-year-old girl who is doing nothing wrong -- and is asking for her mother. When did that become a crime? They see her friends trying to help her and Casebolt drawing his weapon in response. They think it is a miracle that no one got shot. Who's right? I want to start with a different question: If the 14-year-old had blond hair and blue eyes and all the other children were white, would this movie have a different ending? If you answer this question with a yes, then race had something to do with it. If you answer the question with a no, then you don't think race is a factor -- but you would also be delusional. Watch the video. Here's how the white movie would play out. First, it is quite possible that the 911 call is never made. Second, if 911 is called, Casebolt doesn't view the kids as thugs, but he sees them as his own children, or his nieces and nephews and talks to them appropriately. If the teenagers don't obey his command, nobody thinks anything of it. What teenager ever listens to authority? Nothing to see here; no video; no movie; and most importantly no cop suspended, no career in jeopardy. Race had everything to do with McKinney, Texas, but the movie had a happy ending. The 14-year-old's family is not planning a funeral today. We can all be thankful for that. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

            <cabecalho>2015 hurricane season: El Niño could hinder Atlantic storms - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>The 2015 Atlantic hurricane season probably will have fewer storms than normal for the third year running -- thanks in part to El Niño, forecasters say.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)This year's Atlantic hurricane season probably will have fewer storms than normal for the third year running -- thanks in part to El Niño, forecasters say. The Atlantic season, which started Monday, probably will produce six to 11 named storms, forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Climate Prediction Center said last week. Three to six of them could become hurricanes, the center predicted. Both estimates are below the median -- about 12 named storms and 6.5 hurricanes, according to Colorado State University's Tropical Meteorology Project. What could hold hurricane formation back? That would be warm waters in the ocean to the west, said Gerry Bell, NOAA's lead hurricane season forecaster. The phenomenon known as El Niño is back this year. The event, involving the warming of water in the equatorial Pacific, increases strong wind shear in the Atlantic. That reduces the intensity of tropical storms and hurricanes and prevents other systems from becoming powerful enough to be given names. "What El Niño does is it suppresses the hurricane season, mainly during the peak months of the season, which are August, September and October," Bell told reporters during a news conference in New Orleans last week. The outlook does not predict how many storms will hit land. Bell warned that the forecast shouldn't lull people in coastal areas. "Six to 11 named storms is still a fair amount, so be prepared" to evacuate if ordered, he said. NOAA pointed to 1992's Hurricane Andrew, which was one of only seven named Atlantic storms that year. It devastated South Florida, killing at least 26 people and causing $26.5 billion in damage. The Atlantic hurricane season runs though November 30. The region includes the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico and the north Atlantic Ocean. Last season produced eight named storms and six hurricanes. The Eastern Pacific hurricane outlook calls for an above-average season -- 15 to 22 named storms, with seven to 12 hurricanes, the Climate Prediction Center said. It is rare for an Eastern Pacific hurricane to affect the U.S. mainland, though some do have an influence on Hawaii. CNN's Steve Almasy contributed to this report </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Dallas police HQ attack: Suspect James Boulware killed - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>A man suspected of attacking the Dallas police headquarters early Saturday was shot dead following a chase and a standoff, authorities say.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)A man unleashed a barrage of gunfire on Dallas' police headquarters and planted explosives outside the building early Saturday -- narrowly failing to wound anyone -- leading to a chase to a suburb that ended with SWAT officers killing him in his parked van at a restaurant parking lot. Police shot him through the windshield of the armored van about an hour before dawn after he made more threats, sometime after they chased him to the lot outside the Jack in the Box restaurant in the suburb of Hutchins, authorities said. But police didn't confirm his death until the early afternoon, with a bomb squad needing to inspect the vehicle after the suspect told them that the vehicle contained explosives. "We believe this suspect meant to kill officers," police Chief David Brown told reporters. "We barely survived the intentions of this suspect." Before he was shot, the suspect ranted to police by phone, identifying himself as James Boulware, and alleging police were responsible for his child having been taken from him, Brown said. Police have said that they couldn't confirm that the name was the suspect's real identity. Dallas-area resident Jim Boulware told CNN's Sara Sidner that police and agents from the FBI and ATF came to his house and told him that his son, James, had been killed after the standoff. Jim Boulware said he thought his son would have directed his anger not at police but at his mother, who was granted custody of James Boulware's son in April. Authorities wanted to search the house, Jim Boulware said, because his son visited the home a few hours before the shooting. The attack began shortly after midnight, with the man firing an assault weapon and then a shotgun from the outside, riddling police cars and the windows of the headquarters, which sits across the street from a large apartment and office complex. Dallas Deputy Police Chief Gilberto Garza said at times the suspect was on foot as he fired an automatic rifle. "He was always in or just outside his van," the deputy chief said. Officers, staffers and perhaps others narrowly avoided being shot. The chief said rounds hit not only an occupied squad car but also the police headquarters' front lobby, its information desk and the building's second floor. One lobby staffer had just risen from a desk to get a soda -- and bullet holes there suggest that the worker would have been shot otherwise, Brown said. Bullets might have been whizzing near residents across the street, too. Rick Birt, who lives in the South Side on Lamar complex, was taking a phone video of the gunfire from his open apartment window. "I heard snaps overhead, so I could tell that was rounds coming in our direction," Birt, a former Marine, told CNN. Parts of the initial attack were caught on video by several people nearby, and the police chief said he believed the sounds indicated some of the gunfire came close to those making the recordings. But based on the suspect's calls to police, "we think he was specifically targeting police officers," Brown said. The attacker also planted at least one set of pipe bombs in a bag outside, designed to "explode upon touch," Brown said. Police returned fire and gave chase. Video recorded by a witness and aired on CNN shows the dark van ramming the nose of a police car before retreating in reverse.  After the shootout at police headquarters, the suspect called 911 and gave a four- to five-minute rant, accusing of police of being to blame for him losing custody of a child, Brown said. Police later found his number and called him back, eventually allowing SWAT officers to negotiate. Officers pursued the van to the restaurant parking lot in Hutchins -- roughly 13 miles southeast of the Dallas police headquarters -- and the man opened a van door and again shot at police, injuring no one, Brown said. After a gunfire exchange, police called the man for negotiations. Shortly after 4:30 a.m. (5:30 a.m. ET), police used a .50-caliber rifle to hit the engine block, disabling the van, Brown said, because the man on the phone had been increasingly hostile and agitated. Police didn't want him to drive away and threaten anyone else, Brown said. About a half hour later, SWAT snipers shot the man through the van's front windshield, Brown said. The man had become increasingly angry and made threats before cutting off the negotiations, the chief said. The suspect claimed that the van contained C-4 plastic explosives, according to Brown. "They (SWAT officers) made the call, and I believe it's the right call ... to stop his violence," Brown said. Authorities found at least two more pipe bombs in the van, police said. Video from CNN affiliate KTVT showed an explosion near the van, after police said they would use "an explosive water charge" to neutralize any explosives inside. Early Saturday afternoon, KTVT footage showed the van was on fire. "During intentional detonation of susp(ect) ordnance, susp(ect) van caught fire and rounds are going off inside," Dallas police tweeted.  Back outside headquarters, police found at least one package of pipe bombs. It was set to detonate upon touch, Brown said. "(An officer), during the searching, almost tripped over it. If he had touched it, he wouldn't have survived," Brown said. The package exploded when a bomb-squad robot tried to move it Saturday morning, police said. Dallas police posted a tweet showing that vehicles were damaged in the blast.  The crackling sound of the Dallas shootout got the attention of Birt, the ex-Marine who lives across the street from the police headquarters with his wife. "We heard loud noises, my wife asked if I thought they were shots," he said. "I went over to the window and put one of them up. And we heard more shots being fired, and I turned to my wife and said, 'Yeah, that's definitely gunfire.'" He got his cell phone and recorded video. After the van fled, police informed him and his wife that they and others to evacuate the building. Dallas police said the complex's residents might have to stay away for hours, since officers needed to determine whether more bombs were planted in the area. As for the suspect, investigators have no reason to believe the man had "any nexus to terrorism," Brown said. Investigators are looking into whether a van sold in Newnan, Georgia, on eBay last week may be the van used in the Dallas attack, a source familiar with the investigation said. They are investigating, among other things, who may have purchased the vehicle. Jim Boulware said his son took a bus last week to Georgia and bought a van. Witnesses initially indicated up to four people attacked the Dallas police building. But Brown said investigators concluded that only one person was involved and that witnesses were describing the same person at different times and locations.

            <cabecalho>The real issue for #distractinglysexy female scientists - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>A trio of sexist-seeming stories should not have caused the uproar they did; women need to correctly identify their battles before they pick them.</descricao>
            <corpo>Peggy Drexler is the author of "Our Fathers, Ourselves: Daughters, Fathers, and the Changing American Family" and "Raising Boys Without Men." She is an assistant professor of psychology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York and a former gender scholar at Stanford University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer. (CNN)Some of the more provocative headlines of the week seem to want to suggest that, once again, men feel they've got to explain things to women, the slower species. There's the news that JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co CEO Jamie Dimon thinks Elizabeth Warren doesn't understand the global banking system. And the story of the Nobel Laureate scientist who said that women are no good in the lab, because "they fall in love with you, and when you criticize them, they cry." Over at the New York Post, there's the critic who believes that women aren't capable of understanding the movie "GoodFellas." "The wise guys never have to work...," writes Kyle Smith, "which frees them up to spend the days and nights doing what guys love above all else: Sitting around with the gang, busting each other's balls." Women, he writes, can't be around for such ball-busting, because women are the sensitivity police. Many of Smith's points are clearly meant to be incendiary -- clickbait, pure and simple, from a writer long known to court controversy. But I'm inclined to give him the one about women being the sensitivity police, given the giant uproar his short essay about a decades-old movie has generated. For one thing, you don't hear any men complaining that Smith perpetuates the stereotype that all men want to do is sit around being crass and lazy. For another, had this piece been written by a woman arguing that men were incapable of understanding, say, "Thelma &amp; Louise," I'm confident we'd hear not a peep of protest. The news here isn't that men, how dare they, feel the need to explain things to women. Men have been explaining things to women for quite some time. The bigger problem is that women continue to get all fired up about it -- even when the situation doesn't call for so fiery a response. Take the Dimon-Warren kerfuffle. Who says Dimon was attributing Warren's misunderstandings to her gender? That was the media, not Dimon. "Jamie Dimon Wants to Mansplain Banking to Elizabeth Warren," went a headline on Huffington Post. It's hard to imagine this same headline would have run had Dimon lobbed the criticisms at a male politician or gotten nearly the same level of attention if Dimon had, instead, been a female CEO. It's important to stick up for female equality. But taking to the Internet to rally against some sexist ideas in a film critique or comments made, quite obviously, to further a CEO's political agenda (which: the more press the better), isn't going to make salaries equal, change the standards of beauty or lead to more female CEOs. It's just going to give male buffoons even more attention, while furthering the perception that women still aren't equal -- and, what's more, that women themselves are convinced enough of that fact, too, that they have to keep on insisting otherwise. Sexism still exists, in many ways. Some men do think they're superior to women, sure. But these days, it's not so much the general consensus as an easy and guaranteed way to get heard -- whether it's the man or the media looking for the attention, or both. By giving the single opinions of guys such as Jamie Dimon and Kyle Smith and Sir Tim Hunt, the smarmy scientist, all the weight in the world, holding them up as speakers for an entire gender, the media is only hurting the cause for equality. So what if one guy says that, in his opinion, women don't get "GoodFellas"? Why do we care what he thinks or take it for anything more than what it is --a blatant provocation? Women -- or the media that want to speak for them, at least -- need to stop being such easy targets. Because in issuing the battle cry -- in feeling compelled to shout out in defense of a female politician when the criticism likely has more to do with a known adversary's disagreement with her politics, or seek to prove all the ways in which women DO get "GoodFellas" -- women only give credence to the mistaken perception that they are the underdogs in need of defending. They continue the conversation, rather than ending it. Remember what they used to say about how to react to the bullies on the playground? Women would do well to remember that, in many cases, the best course of action may be no course at all. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

            <descricao>CNN Hero Robert Lee's nonprofit picks up fresh food that would otherwise go to waste from New York City restaurants and gets it to people in need.</descricao>
            <corpo>New York (CNN)Like many children, Robert Lee was taught never to waste food. But growing up the son of Korean immigrants who struggled to get by, he really took the idea to heart. In college, Lee joined a student group that delivered leftover dining hall food to homeless shelters. That was when he learned the magnitude of the problem. One in six Americans struggles with food insecurity. Yet in the United States, 40% of food goes to waste. "Just the sheer amount of food that's being wasted is enough to eradicate hunger," Lee said. After graduating two years ago, Lee decided to help take the concept of rescuing food off campus. Together with fellow NYU alum Louisa Chen, he co-founded Rescuing Leftover Cuisine. The nonprofit picks up fresh food that would otherwise go to waste from New York City restaurants and gets it to people in need. Seven days a week, the organization engages volunteers to pick up and deliver any amount of food, no matter how small. Lee says operating on foot makes the group highly efficient. So far, the group has rescued 100,000 pounds of food and delivered it to homeless shelters and food kitchens. Seeing the impact he was making, Lee gave up his finance job at J.P. Morgan last year to focus on his nonprofit full time. The group is partnered with more than 50 food providers throughout New York City. But it's just the beginning, Lee says. Rescuing Leftover Cuisine recently expanded to six other cities across the United States. Do you know a hero? Nominations are open for CNN Heroes 2015 I talked with Lee about his efforts and what he's learned. Below is an edited version of our conversation. CNN: In a short amount of time, your group has already made a big difference. Why do you think it works so well? Robert Lee: We don't have a minimum pound requirement because every little bit of food counts. It can help feed someone. It's also so easy for people to come on and volunteer. The volunteers are crucial to the work that we do. They can sign up on a public calendar on our website. They choose their own commitment. If they want to do weekly, monthly, it's all up to them. And each of our slots are only about 30 minutes long. So it's very easy to fit in to your busy schedule, either along the way home from work or nearby your home. We are working on an app for volunteers to sign up which will be launched this fall. We hope it will be like Uber for delivering leftover food to the homeless! We want to expand our operations so we can rescue millions of pounds of food, by bringing on more volunteers and more restaurant partners. Volunteers learn about the issues of food waste and hunger firsthand. They see how much food is being wasted; they get to actually carry that food. CNN: Has it been challenging to find restaurants to partner with? Lee: It has been surprisingly difficult. When we first started out, we got about five partners for every 100 people that we reached out to. A lot of the restaurants have never even heard of the concept of food rescue. And they thought they would be legally held liable for the food that they were donating. So I'd have to explain to them the legislation (that) basically covers and protects all food donors from legal liability, except in the case of gross negligence. But after we had more partners, we were able to basically point across the street and be like, "Hey, we work with them. This is how it works. We make it very easy for you to do this." CNN: Your group came up with an idea to help the restaurants reduce their waste. How does that work? Lee: On a monthly basis, we supply the restaurant a consolidated report that shows on every single day how much food is being donated to us. They can get a sense of how much food they're actually throwing out and also how many mouths they're able to feed instead. The first partner that we ever had realized they were throwing out $65 a day. And instead of getting their pastries from a wholesaler, they decided to make their own from scratch. So they were able to control exactly how much they were going to produce and the quality of the food they were going to produce. So the quality went up and the food waste went down. Now we only pick up from that restaurant twice a week, and there's very little food, if any at all, to be picked up. That's kind of the best-case scenario. As we tell our partners and restaurants how much excess they have, ideally they would reduce it to the most minimalist level. CNN: You are very passionate about the issue of food waste. How did your upbringing influence that? Lee: It was very difficult for my parents when they first came to the United States. Since an early age we were moving around a lot. It was difficult even to get food sometimes. Hunger is interesting because, at least from my personal perspective, it was not only physical, it was psychological. You don't know where your next meal is coming from. The first time I really realized how much food was being wasted was in elementary school. I always used to eat the school lunch. But there were so many classmates who always talked about how bad it was, and sometimes with no thought, people would just throw it out. To see all that food go to waste is just crazy, you know? Having that perspective puts an urgency to the work that we do. There is so much food being wasted, and we just wanted to make sure that it's going to the right place. Want to get involved?

            <descricao>Jack King, who as a launch commentator for NASA was the voice of the Apollo 11 mission, died Thursday, the space agency said in a press release. He was 84.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Jack King, who as a launch commentator for NASA was the voice of the Apollo 11 moon landing mission, died Thursday, the space agency said in a news release. He was 84. "Jack King counted down the launch of Apollo 11 and all of us watching on television will never forget his calm, reassuring demeanor," said Kennedy Space Center Director Bob Cabana, a former space shuttle astronaut. "Jack was a true professional and helped us understand in common English the complexities of space flight. He was great at communicating what we do at NASA and he will be missed." King, who was from the Boston area, came to NASA in 1960 after a stint as a space program reporter for The Associated Press. He was the agency's manager of press operations for 12 years coinciding with the boom of the space race, when the United States was determined to put a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s. Apollo 11 achieved that goal on July 20, 1969. In an interview with "Spaceflight Now" in 2009, King recalled those years, which ranged from secret test flights to the Apollo missions, seen by hundreds of millions all over the planet. "In Mercury, Gemini and Apollo, we had outstanding leadership and outstanding management," he said. John F. Kennedy's announcement that the United States would land a man on the moon before the end of the decade was a "big boost," he added. "Everything started to fall into place," he said. King's voice was widely recognized as the "voice of launch control" for every mission from Gemini 4 to Apollo 15. "Jack helped establish the original systems to ensure the news media received timely and accurate information about both the early human flight programs and the unmanned missions," Hugh Harris, retired director of NASA Public Affairs at Kennedy, said in NASA's release. But though Apollo 11 is the most celebrated of space missions, King's favorite Apollo mission was Apollo 4 in November 1967: the first launch of the mammoth Saturn V rocket, he told "Spaceflight Now." "We had anticipated this giant rocket, but we didn't know what to expect along any means," he said. Ten months earlier, the program had lost three astronauts in the Apollo 1 fire -- "the low point" of the space program, in King's words -- but the launch of the Saturn V gave NASA new enthusiasm. "Everything clicked off beautifully. I counted it down fine ... and I saw this magnificent thing still sitting on the launch pad, bathing in fire. And finally it lifted off, and the sound hit us," he said. "When it hit us that particular time, the windows in the launch control center just started to rattle, and on top of that, it was a newly constructed building, and all this dust came down from the ceiling. I thought the whole damn place was going to come down on us." King left NASA in 1975. He later worked for Occidental Petroleum's Armand Hammer and a public relations firm specializing in space and science. In 1997, he took a job with the United Space Alliance, a NASA space shuttle contractor. After his retirement in 2010, he worked as a NASA public affairs volunteer, the agency said.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Dems reject Obama's key trade proposal in House vote - CNNPolitics.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>On Obama's trade bill, President Barack Obama will travel to Capitol Hill to meet with Democrats to push for support on a vote related to trade authority.</descricao>
            <corpo>Washington (CNN)Sensing his free trade agenda was hours from a stunning defeat, President Barack Obama went to Capitol Hill on Friday morning to make a personal plea for his own party's support. Democrats ignored him. And now, the prospects for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the biggest free trade deal in history, to be finalized and adopted are grim -- unless Democrats can be convinced to change their minds or Republicans can find another way to revive the bills and rescue Obama's biggest second-term legislative priority. The House overwhelmingly rejected the first in a series of trade bills Friday, with Democrats voting against a program that aids displaced workers -- in large part because, under the chamber's procedures, its defeat meant the vote on the so-called "fast track" bill that followed was only symbolic, so the measure couldn't be sent to Obama's desk. In a statement released Friday afternoon, Obama praised the approval of the fast-track bill and continued to press for passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. "These kinds of agreements make sure that the global economy's rules aren't written by countries like China; they're written by the United States of America," Obama said. "And to stand in their way is to do nothing but preserve the long-term status quo for American workers, and make it even harder for them to succeed." But Friday's votes provided the clearest evidence yet that, with 19 months left in his presidency, Obama's pulpit is less bully than it's ever been before. It also showcased the strength of populist elements of both parties, who beat back an intense lobbying push from traditional Washington forces like the Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers. Friday's vote doesn't mean the package of trade bills are dead. House Republican leaders have called for re-votes by Tuesday, and noted that they could even delay those votes further if necessary, buying Obama a little more time to lobby his own party and GOP leaders time to twist arms. In fact, the most controversial element of the package -- trade promotion authority, which allows Obama to submit deals like the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership to Congress for a vote without amendments, which trade negotiators say is crucial to finalizing the deal -- actually narrowly passed. That vote, though, was meaningless because of House procedural rules that said a separate bill that included Trade Adjustment Assistance -- a program that helps workers who lose their jobs due to trade shifts, and that's typically favored by Democrats -- also had to pass, but it was defeated, 302-126. But the prospect of a re-vote gave the White House reason for optimism on Friday. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest termed the trade failure a "procedural snafu," adding that it still reflected a success that lawmakers were able to pass promotion authority. Earnest called Obama's visit with House Democrats on Friday "productive" and said the President would continue working with lawmakers to advance his trade agenda.  It was House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat who shepherded some of Obama's most controversial first-term bills like health care reform into law, who hurt the President the most on Friday. After staying on the sidelines for most of the trade fight, Pelosi took to the House floor and announced her opposition to the bill -- giving cover to other Democrats who were considering breaking with Obama. She acknowledged the strangeness of Democrats rejecting a Trade Adjustment Assistance measure they've favored for decades, but said the purpose was to win a broader fight. "Our people would rather have a job than trade assistance," Pelosi said. "Its defeat, sad to say, is the only way that we will be able to slow down the fast track." With Pelosi's opposition and Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner in the 2016 presidential race, also keeping mum on trade promotion authority, Obama had scant high-level support within his own ranks.  The President attended a 9:30 a.m. gathering of House Democrats, making his case after several high-level officials -- including Labor Secretary Tom Perez and White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough -- made their cases in the days leading up to the vote. As he left the meeting, Obama said, "I don't think you ever nail anything down around here. It's always moving." Democrats who attended said they weren't swayed and that the President's outreach came too late. "The President tried to both guilt people and impugn their integrity. I was insulted," Rep. Peter Defazio, D-Oregon, told reporters after the meeting. One House Democrat told CNN on the condition of anonymity that in Friday's meeting, Obama "was fine until he turned it at the end and became indignant and alienated some folks. Bottom line, he may have swayed some Ds to vote yes, but Pelosi sealed the deal to vote no." Another House Democrat said Obama's last-minute lobbying effort "absolutely" hurt the bill's chances. "Democrats believe they often are taken granted and not appreciated," this House Democrat said. "There was a very strong concern about the lost jobs and growing income inequality. Unions are the last line of defense. A number of reporters have asked whether Democrats felt threatened by the unions. Most told me that they wanted to do nothing to further weaken unions." Added this member of Congress, pointedly: "Ms. Clinton should take notice." Republicans pushed hard for the trade package, but indicated it would largely be up to Obama to convince Democrats to change their mind on the Trade Adjustment Assistance portion of the set of bills. House Speaker John Boehner called Friday's rejection of that bill "disappointing." "Republicans did our part, and we remain committed to free trade because it is critical to creating jobs and growing our economy," he said. "I'm pleased that a bipartisan House majority supported trade promotion authority. This is an opportunity for the Democratic Party to take stock and move forward in a constructive fashion on behalf of the American people."  Going into the weekend, it was unclear what exactly could change over the weekend to lead to a different result early next week, and which, if any, Democrats would vote differently if the TAA portion of the bill were to be reconsidered. Pelosi already had her demands in mind. In a letter to House Democrats, she said the prospects for trade promotion authority would "greatly increase with the passage of a robust highway bill." Other Democrats made the case that Democrats might realize their gambit could result in the elimination of the Trade Adjustment Assistance program after the symbolic vote in favor of trade promotion authority -- the bill Democrats really want to kill. "If members of my caucus come to the belief that ... you could end up getting fast track without Trade Adjustment Assistance, I think many of my colleagues would reconsider Trade Adjustment Assistance," New York Democratic Rep. Steve Israel said. But, he added, "I don't think anybody knows where we're going right now. Wisconsin Republican Rep. Paul Ryan, the point person for House Republicans on trade, told reporters after Friday's votes, "this isn't over yet." "America is being watched by the rest of world," Ryan warned, adding, "now the President has some work yet to do with his party to complete this process." CNN's Chris Frates, Sunlen Serfaty, Jake Tapper and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <descricao>What happened after allegations of sexual abuse in the "19 Kids and Counting" household shows how ignoring child protection system fails victims.</descricao>
            <corpo>Catherine Pearlman is a social worker and an assistant professor of social work at Brandman University. She's founder of The Family Coach, a business that specializes in helping families resolve everyday problems. Follow her on Twitter @thefamilycoach. (CNN)When the mismanagement of a child abuse case is exposed to the public after an instance of gross neglect or even death, an outcry and reform usually follows. For example, after several children died while under supervision of child welfare in Florida, Gov. Rick Scott recently signed a bill into law to increase funding and provide more comprehensive services. This kind of official response to unthinkable incidents is encouraging. So why is barely a whisper mustered to hold responsible parties accountable under the law when there are allegations of sexual abuse between young people living under one family's roof? Last week the news was full of allegations about the Duggar family (of the TLC network's "19 Kids and Counting" fame) and their eldest son, Josh, who is 27. It was reported that Josh, one of 19 siblings, allegedly molested five girls, including girls who lived in the same house with him, when he was 14 and 15 years old. In response, Josh Duggar did not address specifics of the allegations, but issued an apology, saying: "I acted inexcusably." Exactly what he did that was inexcusable and with whom, the family and authorities won't say. But in heavily redacted police reports, based on detectives' 2006 interviews with his father, James "Jim Bob" Duggar, the elder Duggar recounts repeated instances of a person fondling individuals in his house -- while the victims slept; while standing in the laundry room; while a victim sat on the perpetrator's lap being read to. It would be years before authorities would be told about any of this, and while the family's actions are disturbing, this story highlights what happens when a system meant to protect children from sexual abuse and exploitation, including in instances of incest, doesn't work if adults evade or ignore it. Terrible things can happen in the private culture of a household, and a parent confronting a child's criminal behavior may not want to bring police into the equation. But protecting a family member who is sexually abusing a child in the household risks significant damage to those abused and is unconscionable. When one's child makes the leap from youthful "mistake" to repeat offense, a parent has an obligation to ensure the behavior is reported and stopped. Failing to do this in sexual abuse cases can be a criminal offense from a misdemeanor to a felony. As a social worker, I take being a "mandated reporter" very seriously. Being mandated means that if I suspect any type of abuse, I am legally required to call it in to a hotline. The recipient of the call will then assess if there is enough evidence to warrant an investigation. Depending on where you live, abuse that happens between young people in the same house can be a gray area. In some states, like New York and New Jersey, a sexual act between a minor and a minor is not defined as abuse. The technical definition of abuse only refers to the failure of a parent, guardian, or other adult custodian to protect a child. That is not to say that once reported, abuse would not be investigated. But if it isn't mandated, it might very well go under the radar to begin with. In Arkansas, where the Duggars live, things appear to be clearer. In that state, sexual abuse is explicitly defined as any forcible sexual act done to a person under the age of 18, regardless of the age of the perpetrator. Therefore, when the alleged abuse was discovered by Jim Bob Duggar, church elders, the police, and the state's protective services, one might have expected several actions to occur. Yet, there were striking failures throughout the case. According to Jim Bob Duggar's account, made to police, he learned of the alleged abuse in 2002. He did not report it to police or anyone else. When new allegations surfaced in 2003, he told church elders ("mandated reporters" in Arkansas), who also did not report the abuse. The family and the church decided to send the perpetrator to what they called a Christian work camp for a few months as his punishment and repentance, and he reportedly apologized to his victims. After the perpetrator of the sexual abuse returned home, Jim Bob told police he spoke with a state trooper about the issue. The trooper purportedly gave the perpetrator a stern talking to, In Touch magazine reported. Before the family was scheduled to appear on her show in 2006, Oprah Winfrey was tipped off to the alleged abuse -- more than three years after the first time Jim Bob Duggar told police he'd learned of it. She did report the allegations. A police investigation followed. Here is where the system really begins to fall apart. Police apparently "investigated" the allegations but never spoke with the alleged perpetrator. That's correct. The subject of the investigation was never investigated. Realizing that the three-year statute of limitations had expired, the police then referred the case to the state's Department of Human Services for further investigation, In Touch reported. All of the records from that inquiry are sealed. And there are many details still unknown. Whatever really happened, we know only this -- from Josh Duggars' statement: "I acted inexcusably for which I am extremely sorry and deeply regret. I hurt others, including my family and close friends. I confessed this to my parents who took several steps to help me address the situation. We spoke with the authorities where I confessed my wrongdoing, and my parents arranged for me and those affected by my actions to receive counseling. I understood that if I continued down this wrong road that I would end up ruining my life." But there is no available account of what was done to protect the alleged victims of sex abuse in the Duggar household. Aside from his short time away after the second incident, there is no evidence that the perpetrator of the repeated alleged abuse was kept away from his alleged victims -- perhaps even permanently -- as a counselor might have advised. What should have happened is simple. The Duggar parents should have taken immediate and effective steps to ensure everyone was safe -- that victim and perpetrator had counseling from people trained and licensed to provide such services. The state trooper, upon hearing about the issue from Jim Bob Duggar, should have immediately called the case in to the child abuse hotline. The church elders should have done the same. Failing to report known abuse, especially when the perpetrator admits to the abuse, has legal consequences. Law in Arkansas states that mandated reporters who knowingly, recklessly, and purposely fail to make a report have committed a Class A or C felony. Additionally, they can and should be held civilly liable. The statute of limitations should have never been so modest for a crime committed against children. Furthermore, the current statute states that prosecution can proceed even if the limitations have expired only if the offense was never reported to a law enforcement officer. So if a police officer does not fulfill his or her duty to respond appropriately within the allotted time, there is no justice for the victims. This has to change. The message to the victims, and to girls everywhere, is clear: You are not protected. Telling authorities what happened to you will neither protect you from its happening again nor bring your assailant to justice; men and boys are more valued and you should defer to what is best for them; blame yourself and do it silently. Over much of the last seven years, the nation watched and adored the Duggar family for its values. We lauded their unity and praised their parenting techniques. Now we need to use this case to hold those in positions to protect children accountable. There is a viral debate now over whether TLC should cancel "19 Kids and Counting." Who cares? Putting the focus on the show and not the issue is just one more failure in a long list of them. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

            <cabecalho>How escaped killers will give themselves away  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Unstable men liked NY prison fugitives ruled by ruthlessness, rage that makes them slip up. And fear gives the community great incentive to keep heat on.</descricao>
            <corpo>Philip Lerman is the former co-executive producer of "America's Most Wanted." (CNN)The question on everyone's mind is: What are the chances that the two escaped murderers from the Dannemora prison can stay on the loose? The answer, as we learned over more than 20 years of chasing fugitives at "America's Most Wanted": In the very short run, their chances are pretty good. But in the slightly-less-than-short run, almost nil. One thing we gleaned from all the manhunts we were part of is the simple fact that, let's face it, fugitives are not the smartest people in the world. That's how they got to be fugitives in the first place. It takes enormous luck, incredible planning and meticulous attention to detail to remain a fugitive. Most of the fugitives we went after, if they weren't caught by the show, managed to get themselves caught pretty quickly on their own. They ran a red light, had a taillight out, used a stolen credit card and got caught on a 7-Eleven surveillance camera, walked into a coffee shop where the waitress happened to be looking at their pictures on a website, or got into a bar fight at the wrong place at the wrong time. One false move and some cop, somewhere, is going to run a fingerprint, or make a visual connection, and the jig is up. And even if they do try to watch their every step, it's not enough. In one case, a fugitive's overly cautious demeanor was what gave him away. He started dating a girl whose father noticed that he never drove over 55, always came to a full stop at every stop sign, carefully fed every parking meter, always wore his seat belt. "Nobody's that careful," the dad told us. "Unless they have something to hide." So even the most careful fugitives manage, sooner rather than later, to get themselves caught. And if we know anything about Richard Matt and David Sweat, it's that they are not cautious, methodical, careful, thoughtful individuals. Despite a well-planned and well-executed escape, they are, from all reports, total lunatics. Sweat was serving a life sentence without parole for killing Broome County Sheriff's Deputy Kevin Tarsia in 2002. But shooting him 15 times wasn't enough. He decided to run him over with a car. Matt was convicted for kidnapping a businessman for 27 hours and -- when the victim didn't comply with his demands for money -- killing him. And not just killing him: A man who drove a car for one of Matt's victims told Anderson Cooper that Matt shoved a knife sharpener in his victim's ear, broke his neck and then dismembered the body. These are not calm individuals at work. It is easier for fugitives to stay on the loose in the summer than it is in the winter; but they still have to eat, they probably will want to drink, and these two are unlikely to be the kinds of survivalists who can patiently wait out the summer in the woods until the heat dies down. And from experience, it doesn't seem likely that the heat will die down on this case. There are two things that motivate the public, and the police, to maintain a manhunt. One is sympathy for the victim: Everyone wants to see justice done. The other is fear: The belief that the fugitives, if not caught, will kill again. It doesn't appear that the sympathy aspect has taken hold in this case: Sad to say, there have been few stories about the victims, about the families they left behind, the partners and parents and friends for whom this escape is a terribly, painfully personal affront. We learned that sharing those stories can be a powerful motivator. But so is fear, and in this case, that is justified. These are men who have clearly shown that they are ruled by ruthlessness and rage -- and that is plenty of motivation for making sure this story doesn't fade away, as too many fugitive stories do. The $100,000 reward won't hurt, either. Some have surmised that these two men must have help on the outside. That can make a difference -- but not as much as you think. Witness their purported getaway driver who, according to CNN sources, had an anxiety attack before the escape, and went to the hospital instead of the pickup point. It takes a really good friend to harbor you as a fugitive -- and these don't sound like the kinds of guys who make friends easily. There are always exceptions to the rule. We can name several fugitives who stayed on the run for a dozen years or more (I'm looking at you, Whitey Bulger). But those tend to be well-connected men with well-financed operations. Not a couple of crazed fugitives on the run without a car or a bankroll. The odds are stacked against them. Let's just hope the odds play out before anyone else gets hurt.

            <cabecalho>Connecticut's gun law linked to large homicide drop - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>The rate of gun-related murders fell sharply in the 10 years after Connecticut implemented a law requiring people buying guns to have a license, study says.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The rate of gun-related murders fell sharply in the 10 years after Connecticut implemented a law requiring people buying firearms to have a license, according to a study. In 1995, a permit-to-purchase handgun law went into effect in Connecticut, stating that people who want to buy a gun must apply for a license (or permit) with the local police, a process that involves a background check, as well as complete at least eight hours of gun safety training. The law also raised the minimum purchasing age from 18 to 21. To assess the effect of this law, researchers identified states that had levels of gun-related homicide similar to Connecticut before 1995. These include Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Maryland. When the researchers compared these states to Connecticut between 1995 and 2005, they found the level of gun-related homicide in Connecticut dropped below that of comparable states. Based on the rates in these comparable states, the researchers estimated Connecticut would have had 740 gun murders if the law had not been enacted. Instead, the state had 444, representing a 40% decrease. "I did expect a reduction [but] 40% is probably a little higher than I would have guessed," said Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research who led the study, which was published Friday in the American Journal of Public Health. Related: The CNN Guns Project "I think we have strong evidence that this is a policy that saves lives, and not a small number of lives," Webster said. Ten states have laws similar to Connecticut's, including background check requirements. It is hard to know what effect permit-to-purchase laws have without looking in these other states, said John R Lott Jr., president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, a gun rights advocate and columnist for Fox News. "If 10 states passed a law, eight could increase and two could fall, and how do I know that it was because of the gun law?" he said. Although Webster said he would like to study the effect of gun laws in other states, that research is not practical. Most states passed meaningful gun laws, such as laws requiring background checks, long ago, "frankly before I was born," and it would be hard to know how those laws were enforced back then, and how society responded to them, he explained. In addition, information from death certificates was less readily available from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before 1980, he said. Massachusetts passed a gun law more recently, in 1998, and the number of firearm-related homicides reportedly increased after the law. However, this law did not really change how people buy guns in the state because a law requiring background checks had already been in place for decades, Webster said. The 40% decrease in firearm-related homicide that Webster's study suggested for Connecticut is "pretty substantial and quite impressive," said Brad J. Bushman, professor of communications and psychology at The Ohio State University who studies gun violence in the media and aggressive behavior. Bushman was not involved in the current study, nor has he conducted any research with Webster, although the two serve together on President Obama's committee on gun violence and the National Science Foundation youth violence advisory committee. Webster and his colleagues took into account other factors that could have contributed to the decline in gun-related homicide, such as changes in population size and shifts in demographics, when they compared the numbers in Connecticut to those in similar states before and after 1995. The fact that they still predicted the drop in firearm homicide in Connecticut at the turn of the 21st century suggests it can't be because of these other factors, Bushman said. The researchers also looked at rates of nonfirearm homicide and found no difference between Connecticut and other states across the time frame of the study (1985-2005), suggesting the drop in gun-related murders in Connecticut was not simply due to waning murder rates in the state overall. Webster and his colleagues did not look at rates of gun-related violence in the study because inconsistencies in police reports of violence would make interpretation of the numbers difficult, Webster said. It is hard to predict whether Connecticut would continue to see lower rates of gun-related homicide beyond 2005, Webster said. He and his colleagues found the numbers did rebound after the period in the study. Although it is not clear why rates of gun death rose in Connecticut starting in 2006, there was also an increase in gun deaths nationwide in that time, Webster said. In an earlier study, Webster and his colleagues found there was an inverse, although smaller, change in Missouri after the state repealed its 1921 permit-to-purchase law in 2007. They saw a 23% increase in gun-related murders between 2007 and 2010, compared to between 1999 and 2007. Webster presented the findings of the Connecticut and Missouri studies on June 11 at a press event in Washington held by Faiths United To Prevent Gun Violence, a coalition of faith leaders from across the United States, to support laws like the one in Connecticut. "I'm glad that they are mobilizing to try to enact a policy that will save lives," Webster said. The U.S. Congress will also introduce a bill that would allow the federal government to give money to states with handgun purchaser licensing laws to help support systems in those states for reviewing applications and issuing permits. "A lot of the debate around guns has more to do with the culture, do you like or hate guns, and how do you interpret the Second Amendment," Webster said. "What's important here is that a bill is introduced that is based on a foundation of scientific research showing this will save lives."  </corpo>

            <descricao>Asian-American kids, desperate to gain admission to elite colleges, are now getting coaches to teach them how to be "less Asian." </descricao>
            <corpo>Jeff Yang is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal Online and contributes frequently to radio shows, including Public Radio International's "The Takeaway" and WNYC's "The Brian Lehrer Show." He is the co-author of "I Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action" and editor of the graphic novel anthologies "Secret Identities" and "Shattered." The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)Asian-American kids, desperate to gain admission to elite colleges, are now getting coaches to teach them how to be "less Asian." Put another way, these coaches are supposed to teach young Asian-Americans how to get out of the stereotypes that we know them by. You know how the caricature goes: We're STEM-brained but inarticulate. Industrious but uninspired. Capable but lacking in creativity. We're robots who can only copy and clone and grub and grind. It's a perception that's regularly used against both Asian-Americans and Asians in Asia. Just last week, Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina calling China a nation of people who can "take a test" but who are "not terribly imaginative," applying a broad-based insult to a population of over 1 billion. And yet, as much as we may publicly bristle at the notion that Asians are "boring academic robots," it's tough to cast this image off when loud segments of our community are doing their best to reinforce it. Case in point: The Asian-American groups that gathered a few weeks ago to file a complaint with the Department of Education, charging that Asians who get higher grades and better test scores are being shortchanged by admissions officers at Harvard College following the standard practice of "holistic review." Holistic review gives colleges a means to analyze qualified students — even the complainants don't suggest that candidates who make it as far as the review process are anything less than academically outstanding — to assemble incoming classes that are diverse in interest, opinion, experience and, yes, culture, race and ethnicity. The Asian-American organizations behind this complaint are, of course, laser-focused on the last of these to the exclusion of all the other factors. But in the course of slamming holistic review as part of a racially discriminatory conspiracy against Asian applicants, they're also supporting the notion that we can't compete when measured on metrics other than grades and test results. That's because these advocates have chosen to focus on SAT scores as their primary evidence that colleges do not embrace "meritocracy." But the fact is, unlike in Asian countries like China, Korea or Japan, American colleges do not use the results of a single national exam as the sole metric for college placement, and for good reason. Doing so is a recipe for cranking out students who are focused on "learning to the test" and who don't have the time or bandwidth to pursue their own personal pastimes and obsessions — the kinds of things that tend to enrich character, expand horizons and make you a more interesting person. iReport: Why I had to unlearn lessons from my Asian-American upbringing Asian parents certainly have their children's best interest at heart. But in many cases, their educational perspective has been shaped by exams and numerical placements, from growing up in societies where standardized test results and the colleges that they place you in define your entire life. It's not surprising that, for them, merit equals test results, and softer traits — like passion, imagination and originality — seem less worthy of inclusion in the process of judging an applicant's qualifications for college admission. And yet, those quirks are what catch admissions officers' eyes. When faced with a sea of applicants whose test scores are all in the 99th percentile and who have demonstrated spectacular academic success throughout their educational careers, you don't stand out by scoring 2400 instead of 2228 (the median SAT score for Harvard's entering class last year) or by having perfect grades in high school (as did 54% of Harvard freshmen). Everyone's a high achiever, but the lucky individuals admitted to the class of 2018 were the ones who had unique and compelling stories to tell. The notion that kids might thrive by being different doesn't come naturally to Asian immigrant parents, raised as they were in more rigid academic cultures. That's why a growing number are turning to consulting companies like Top Tier, Ivy Coach and ThinkTank Learning for advice on how to help their kids to look not just smart, but special, by highlighting their more idiosyncratic pursuits and interests. The cost? As much as hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. It's ironic. Asian-American parents who've pushed their children to conform to two-dimensional templates are now paying big money for programs designed to release them from their tiger cages and unleash their hidden iconoclasts. Here's a thought: Why not save that money — and the outrage and effort being expended on campaigns for test-centric meritocracy — and encourage the dreams and passions of your kids instead?

            <corpo>(CNN)Their hopes have long faded, their prayers gone unanswered. Still, they wait by the banks of the Yangtze River, lighting candles and calling out the names of their loved ones. A week ago Monday, the Eastern Star -- a passenger ship on a pleasure cruise along a stretch of the Yangtze that winds through central China's Hubei province -- went down during a storm. Four hundred and fifty six people -- mostly senior citizens -- were on board. Only 14 survived. By Monday, search crews had recovered 434 bodies. Eight remain missing. It's the deadliest boat disaster in China in almost 70 years. "I wish this was a nightmare," Guan Yuan told Xinhua, China's state-run news agency. "But nothing happens when I wake up." Guan's parents were aboard the ship, taking their first long vacation since retiring, she said. "My parents rarely traveled to save money for my education," she told the news agency. Bereft of the possibility of a happy reunion, family members had hoped to be able to claim the bodies and take them home. But authorities said that they will be cremated in local funeral homes. "It's too bad that people back home won't able to see their deceased family members for the last time," said Hu Jinwei, who lost four members of his family including his mother. "I heard bodies were badly damaged. It would be unbearable to see them. I just want my families' (ashes) back home as soon as possible, not suffering anymore." The bodies of Hu's stepfather, aunt and uncle have been identified and he is anxiously waiting to hear if his mother has been identified. So far, forensic teams using DNA to identify the victims have only made 97 matches.  The rescue and recovery operation has involved nearly 150 other ships, 59 machines, 3,400 Chinese troops and 1,700 paramilitary personnel, state news agency Xinhua said. Officials have expanded the search area to include more than 600 miles downstream and warned ships to be on the look out for floating bodies. Authorities took the captain and the chief engineer into custody, but have revealed little about what they have said other than that a tornado hit the ship.  The Yangtze is the third-longest river in the world, stretching 6,300 kilometers (3,915 miles) from its source in the mountains of Tibet all the way to the East China Sea. The Eastern Star had been making multiple stops on its journey up the river from Nanjing to Chongqing, a city hundreds of kilometers inland. River cruises along the Yangtze are popular among both Chinese and international tourists. It capsized around 9:30 p.m. Monday during a storm over the section of the river that flows through Hubei's Jianli County, authorities said. It's unclear why the Eastern Star was the only ship on the busy waterway so badly affected by the storm. The captain and the chief engineer both said the ship had been hit by a "longjuanfeng," a Chinese word that can be translated as cyclone or tornado, Xinhua reported. The China Meteorological Center said a tornado less than 1 kilometer in diameter and lasting 15 to 20 minutes occurred, China Daily reported.  Images of the upended ship evoked memories of the Sewol, the South Korean passenger ferry that sank last year, taking the lives of more than 300 people, most of them high school students. The captain of that ship was convicted of murder in April and sentenced to life in prison. In this case, the majority of the 405 passengers on the cruise were between 50 and 80 years old, according to a list published by state media. The youngest was 3. There were also 46 crew members and five travel agency workers on board, according to state media. All those on board were reported to be Chinese. CNN's Shen Lu and Serena Dong in Beijing journalist Wayne Chang in Hong Kong contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Why China's space program stands out - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>China is one of several nations and new commercial players which may come to dominate the space race in the 21st century, writes space author Louis Brennan.</descricao>
            <corpo>Dr Louis Brennan is a Fellow of Trinity College Dublin and a Professor within the School of Business. He previously served as Director of the Institute for International Integration Studies and as Chair of the Workshop on the non-Science Impacts of Large Scale Science Infrastructures -- the case of the Global SKA (Square Kilometre Array) project. He is the author along with Alessandra Vecchi of The Business of Space, published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2011. (CNN)China by virtue of the ambition of its space program stands out. Already, it has managed to land a rover on the Moon and to return an unmanned spacecraft from orbiting the Moon as part of its preparation for an eventual manned landing. It also aims to have a manned space station operational by 2020. China is a relatively new actor among the traditional space powers, the Soviet Union and the United States. The quest to conquer space was driven from the middle of the 20th century by the rivalry between them. National pride was inextricably linked to the early achievements of getting a man into space and landing on the Moon. Yet amid that competitive rivalry and even prior to the end of the Cold War, the competing superpowers had begun to collaborate. The launch of the MIR space station in February 1986 that preceded the development of the International Space Station in the 1990s represented a notable shift from fierce rivalry to global collaboration. And that collaboration between the two former rivals has continued uninterrupted until very recently. An array of other actors has gained prominence in space endeavors in recent decades. These have included the European Space Agency (ESA), established in 1975, and a number of other states including Brazil, China, India, Iran and Japan. China has already achieved rapid success and has more long-term plans for deeper venturing into space including to Mars. India's space related activities are notably due to its low cost prowess in achieving its space related goals as demonstrated in its recent successful mission to send a craft to orbit around Mars. At the same time, the two dominant states have over recent decades reduced substantially their national space budgets. For example, in the case of the U.S., space related government expenditure has reportedly declined from a high of 4.5% during the Apollo era to below 0.5% today. However, success in space remains a major source of national prestige, pride and celebration. This was very evident to me some years ago, when I was dining one night in a restaurant in Kuala Lumpur. The arrival of the first Malaysian astronaut and visitor to the International Space Station Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor generated an air of celebratory excitement and pride among the clientele and he was mobbed as a celebrity. That sense of national achievement has also been evident in the feting of China's taikonauts and in the case of India's success in space. The continuing allure and mystique of space was dramatically demonstrated with the Mars One Foundation reportedly receiving some 200,000 applications from 140 countries for its proposed one way mission to Mars. Likewise, there are examples of firms seeking to promote their brands by leveraging an association with space. This has been most notably the case with Unilever's Axe brand promoting its Apollo line with a global contest for spaceflights provided by the Space Expedition Corporation. As the commitment of the former superpowers to space has waned, recent years have seen the participation of private actors in space related activity and the emergence of the business of space. During the 1990s, the commercial space industry started to flourish and ties to the military lessened. In particular, the space market has expanded into new niche sectors -- space tourism and travel, mining of resources, manufacturing opportunities, satellite technology -- representing a shift towards privatization of the sphere. We also have super-empowered individuals -- the inventors and entrepreneurs driving this commerce. This new millennium is an important time in the history of space, not just for science, but in the opportunities for business enterprise and commercialization. Increasingly, entrepreneurs and other private entities not only undertake activities previously carried out by governments and its agencies but also start to venture into previously unexplored and unexploited opportunities in space. SpaceX is already a contractor for NASA, supplying the International Space Station. It was successful in getting its first commercial satellite delivery off the ground using its Falcon 9 rocket in December 2013 and is making progress towards reusing its launch rockets. This new millennium is an important time in the history of space, not just for science, but in the opportunities for business enterprise and commercialization. Increasingly, entrepreneurs and other private entities not only undertake activities previously carried out by governments and its agencies but also start to venture into previously unexplored and unexploited opportunities in space. Such an achievement would be a game changer for the business of space as it would reduce significantly the costs. A plethora of new space companies offering a diverse range of services have emerged that include suborbital hops, orbital flights and hotels, lunar tourism and satellite services. Space endeavors are seen as the next big business in Silicon Valley with companies such as Google investing in them. The establishment of permanently manned space stations in outer space and the vision of establishing Lunar and Martian colonies have been embraced by private entrants such as Bas Lansdorp of Mars One and Elon Musk of SpaceX. While space exploration is consistent with humanity's pioneering history and offers commercial opportunities particularly arising from reusability, miniaturization and economies of scale, it is today arguably more than an opportunity -- it is a necessity. Stephen Hawking has asserted that if the human species is to continue beyond the next 100 years, its future is in space. Elon Musk of SpaceX has posited the goal of establishing ourselves as a multi-planetary species. If the vision of humanizing space is to become a reality, it requires research and development, innovation and risk-taking. Moreover, it becomes an imperative to introduce innovative business models. When Lans Lansdorp started to conceive the idea of colonizing Mars, he saw as his most daunting challenge the development of the business model. He told the New York Times: "All the technology we need exists already -- or nearly exists, I just couldn't figure out how to finance it." In today's world, the financing of space business is quite different from that of 1957. Private actors are beginning to invest in space and some wealthy individuals with an established record of success in other business have already established enterprises with space related missions. Rich individuals are paying for their tickets to travel into space, while national governments face severe constraints on their spending policies. Nonetheless, the role of the state will continue to be an integral part of space endeavors, not least given the military and intelligence implications of space and the emergence of state actors such as China with its lofty space ambitions. Future space endeavors will be driven by a mix of state actors, corporations and individuals. Although space continues to be risky (as we recently experienced with the crash of Virgin Galactic's SpaceShip Two), the combination of humankind's innate urge to explore, the vast opportunities that space offers and terrestrial imperatives will see a continued growth in space actors and activities.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho> A secret Navy flight over China's military buildup - CNNPolitics.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>It's no accident that the first P8s were deployed to Asia. The P8 is one expression of the Obama administration's pivot to Asia, and here it's watching China.</descricao>
            <corpo>Above the South China Sea (CNN)Take-off is swift on the U.S. Navy's P8-A Poseidon -- there's no slow roll down the runway on military flights -- and within minutes, the turquoise blue of the South China Sea comes into view from the window of America's most advanced surveillance and sub-hunting aircraft. The P8 crew, composed of more than a dozen naval aviators, invited me into the cockpit to watch and to listen. CNN last week first reported on this secret surveillance mission, which eight times received warnings from the Chinese navy to leave the contested area. This is a behind-the-scenes look at the journey. Approaching the P8-A Poseidon on the tarmac, it's easy to mistake the sophisticated aircraft for one of the many other Boeing 737 planes around it. The P8 is based on a 737 frame, but the similarities end there. Exclusive: China warns U.S. surveillance plane Peeking out of the fuselage are numerous antennas, domes and camera wells, plus a bomb bay for sub-hunting torpedoes and spaces under the wings for Harpoon air-to-surface missiles. Inside, the jet is home to an array of advanced intelligence-gathering equipment. I have the feeling of entering a CIA listening station in the sky. It's no accident that the first P8s -- only 18 months old -- were deployed to Asia. The P8 is one expression of the Obama administration's pivot to Asia, and its principle mission here is keeping a watchful eye on China. Once we're aboard, we sit in on the flight crew's "delta briefing," the final briefing before takeoff. The aircraft's commander, Lt. Cmdr. Matt Simpson, lays out the mission plan. The P8 will leave from Clark Air Base in the Philippines and fly some 460 miles west to three reefs -- Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief -- which Beijing has rapidly been transforming into expansive islands and, the U.S. fears, soon-to-be permanent military stations 600 miles from China's coastline. From the air, the waters appear quiet and peaceful, but 60% of world trade traffics through here. And underneath the sea floor are believed to be enormous deposits of oil and gas. That helps explain the international free-for-all underway to claim an array of barely visible reefs and shoals. It's not only China but also the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei that are involved. Though the coastlines of the other countries are all closer than China's, they are still more than 200 miles away, far from their territorial waters, which by international law extend only 12 miles out from shore. America's own coastline is, of course, thousands of miles away, but the U.S. is still very much in the mix. It's the defender, in effect, of free passage through international waters for all international cargo ships and, crucially, the U.S. Navy. Forty-five minutes into the flight, the first mission target comes into view: Subi Reef. More than two dozen Chinese dredgers fill the lagoon, pumping sand from the ocean floor in huge plumes onto the surface, slowly and gradually building up an island from scratch. The scale and pace of their work is mesmerizing. In two years, China has expanded the surface area of reefs it claims in the South China Sea from just five acres to more than 2,000. The P8 crew expect the Chinese navy to warn them away as we approach. Usually these "challenges," as they refer to them, come once the jet is within a few miles, and indeed, the radio soon relays a voice speaking in Chinese-accented English: "This is the Chinese navy. This is the Chinese navy ... Please leave immediately to avoid misunderstanding." From both sides, the communication is calm and, mostly, professional. The American pilot quickly responds from a well-rehearsed script explaining that this is a U.S. aircraft operating in international airspace over international waters. U.S. threatens peace in South China Sea, Beijing says Still, as the Chinese navy radio operators come back on the line to repeat their warning, I can hear frustration building in their voices. In one case, the operator's voice grows louder and louder, ending in a high-pitched "You go!" The Chinese give warnings like this eight times during the flight. It turns out there are also civilian aircraft in the vicinity. A Delta Air Lines flight on that same frequency hears the Chinese challenge, and then pipes into the frequency to ask what's going on. The Chinese navy radio operator identifies himself, possibly to reassure them. The flight crew notes that this can be a very nerve-racking experience for civilian aircraft in the area. For now, these Chinese challenges are surface-to-air, coming from new early-warning radar stations they have positioned on the islands or from Chinese navy ships patrolling them. These reefs are too far from air bases in China for Chinese aircraft to intercept the P8 and start a potential confrontation in the air, but that may change if and when these islands have working airstrips. Fact is, China is already on its way. As we leave Subi Reef, we approach Fiery Cross Reef a few minutes travel away. Here China has made the most extensive progress. What used to be a rocky reef barely visible above the waves is now equipped with a nearly completed runway, a tower, an early warning radar station and barracks for Chinese soldiers and sailors. Meanwhile, Chinese dredgers continue to dig away at a deep-water harbor for Chinese ships. This is what some call China's "unsinkable aircraft carrier." If China continues to militarize the islands, as the U.S. fears, the three reefs will form strategic Chinese military bases right in the middle of some of the most contested waters in the world. On board the P8, the mood is calm and confident. These crews have been flying these flights for months now. But the more China builds, the U.S. sailors tell me, the more aggressively the Chinese navy is challenging them. CNN has learned that the U.S. is considering flying its aircraft -- and sailing its Navy warships -- even closer to the islands to further demonstrate that the U.S. does not recognize China's claims. The lowest we fly on this mission is 15,000 feet. But that could soon change. And what happens if China starts deploying its aircraft to these waters? The airstrip on Fiery Cross Reef is already long enough to accommodate every military aircraft in the Chinese arsenal. P8 flights hundreds of miles closer to the mainland are already intercepted by Chinese fighters. Last fall, in one such encounter, the Chinese pilot came dangerously close. The prospect of U.S.-Chinese collisions in the air are truly alarming, as past events have demonstrated. In 2001, a Chinese jet collided with a U.S. EP-3, the P8's predecessor, over Hainan Island, right off the Chinese mainland, leading to a major crisis as the damaged U.S. plane barely managed a safe landing on Chinese territory. The P8 flight crew speaks confidently and calmly about their mission. But they know they are in the midst of a major and contentious potential conflict. Chinese protests are becoming more stern. U.S. surveillance flights and naval patrols are becoming more aggressive. And the two countries' positions are, for now, irreconcilable. China views these islands as its sovereign territory and describes its commitment to them as "unshakable." The U.S. views the area as international waters and airspace. Aboard the P8, it is difficult to see how those differences are resolved.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Idolized food lovers, who amass thousands of followers, tell CNN their favorite go-to restaurants in Hong Kong.</descricao>
            <corpo>This story complements the Culinary Journeys TV series, airing monthly on CNN International. See more of the show at cnn.com/journeys. Share photos of your own Culinary Journeys on Instagram with the hashtag #CNNFood for a chance to be featured on CNN. (CNN)A bowl of juicy roast pork noodles? Liked. A plate of crispy French fries accompanying a perfect piece of steak? Liked. A warm molten lava cake paired with vanilla bean ice cream? Liked and, if the comments are to be believed, actively drooled over. In a foodstagram-obsessed city like Hong Kong, scrolling through other people's social media dinner photos is a popular pastime. So no surprise that some so-called food bloggers have achieved almost superstar status. We challenged five of the top Hong Kong-based gastronauts to name their all-time favorite restaurant in a city with thousands of them.  "Asking a food lover what their favorite restaurant is, is like asking a father which of his children he likes best," says e-ting's Janice Leung, a writer and editor specializing in travel, lifestyle, culture and, obviously, food. Her top selection for Hong Kong is Seventh Son in Wan Chai, which she argues serves the best Cantonese food on the planet. "The food served is a great example of Cantonese culinary traditions, be it meticulously made dim sum, or some of the best roast suckling pig money can buy." Seventh Son, 4/F to 6/F, Kwan Chart Tower, 6 Tonnochy Road, Wan Chai; +852 2892 2888; lunch 11:30 a.m.-3 p.m., dinner 6-11 p.m.  Michelle Ng is the mastermind behind the food blog Chopstixfix. She claims she's loved food since before she can recall. "I struggle to nominate a favorite restaurant in Hong Kong as there are too many I truly enjoy going to, but one place that I have a real soft spot for is Yu Chuan in Wan Chai," says Ng. "The quality and execution of the food is excellent and the cost is wallet-friendly. "I love a lot of their dishes but my all-time favorite is the Ma Po Tofu." Yu Chuan, Shop B, 1/F, Hundred City Center, 7-17 Amoy St., Wan Chai; +852 2838 1561; open daily 6-11 p.m.  Hong Kong based communications consultant and food writer Chris Dwyer also admits zeroing in on a single eatery is difficult. "In a city with 40,000 places to eat, choosing a favorite is agonizing and almost impossible." When forced at knife and fork point, he goes for Caprice at the Four Seasons. Why? "The harbor views, calm decadence and understated but faultless service help, but most of all it's the brilliant French cuisine." "Chef de cuisine Fabrice Vulin isn't afraid to weave in global flavors and ingredients, creating stellar dishes such as the outrageously good pork belly with black truffle." Caprice at Four Seasons Hotel Hong Kong, 8 Finance St., Central; +852 3196 8888; open daily noon-11:30 p.m.  Nicole Fung runs That Food Cray, a global gastronomic, travel and lifestyle online media platform -- which is a fancy way to say she runs a food blog. The writer's all-time favorite is nothing fancy though. Shun Hing Long Gwai Kee Soya Product Factory in Cheung Sha Wan is an unassuming old school soybean product shop. "This place reminds me of my grandparents. "I don't have many memories of my grandparents, but I do remember them taking me for tofu pudding every time we visited Hong Kong at this little tiny tofu shop," says Fung. "Every time I'm in the neighborhood, I reminisce with a bowl of tofu pudding with soy milk and a plate of griddle fried tofu with fish paste." Shun Hing Long Gwai Kee Soya Product Factory, 451 Shung Ning Road, Cheung Sha Wan; +852 2386 7743; open daily 7 a.m.-7 p.m.  The Dimsum Diaries is a food blog run by Alejandra Wilkinson, who started writing food reviews as a tribute to her love for food. "One of my favorite places to eat in Hong Kong has got to be Le Bistro Winebeast," says Wilkinson. The food at this Wan Chai restaurant is completely faultless and the service excellent, she says. The cozy atmosphere "makes you feel like you could actually be in a little bistro in Paris." Aside from the best steak tartare she's ever had, Wilkinson raves about its well-priced and fantastic wine. Le Bistro Winebeast, 15 McGregor St., Wan Chai; +852 2479 6833; open Tuesday-Sunday, noon-3 p.m., 6-11 p.m.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>How China's 'Great Cannon' works - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Nicholas Weaver: Researchers explain how China's "Great Cannon" is said to attack website targets. He says the implications are dangerous. </descricao>
            <corpo>Nicholas Weaver is a researcher with the International Computer Science Institute at Berkeley University. He was one of the lead authors of a report on China's "Great Cannon," which was released by The Citizen Lab in April. The opinions expressed in this commentary are the author's own. China hasn't directly addressed claims about the existence of the Great Cannon, but says it's interested in working with the international community to keep "cyberspace peaceful, secure, open and cooperative." (CNN)Readers may have heard of the "Great Firewall," the powerful filters that the People's Republic of China uses to prevent Chinese citizens from accessing the whole Internet. The Great Firewall monitors traffic entering and exiting China, and then disrupts prohibited content and connections. Imagine an eavesdropper on a party line: when one party says something objectionable, the eavesdropper shouts into the line until everyone hangs up. While very effective, the Firewall is not an offensive weapon. The device we dubbed the "Great Cannon" is different; it acts as a "man-in-the-middle," able to not just shout down a conversation but actually able to change content as it passes through the Internet. Unlike the Great Firewall, whoever designed the Great Cannon created a deliberately offensive tool, designed to selectively replace benign web content with malicious content. The only known use of the Great Cannon was to further Chinese censorship. Study: China cybercensors attack outside its borders with 'Great Cannon' The organization GreatFire seeks to monitor and circumvent Chinese censorship. One technique it's developed has been dubbed "Collateral Freedom" -- hosting content on encrypted services that it believes are "too important to block."  During March and April, when a non-Chinese web surfer visited a page containing unencrypted content served by Chinese search engine Baidu, the Great Cannon would occasionally replace that content with a series of instructions for the web surfer's browser. These instructions caused the browser to repeatedly fetch content from "Collateral Freedom" pages, executing a "denial of service" (DOS) attack. It would be like an attacker telling tens of thousands of cellphones to all dial the same number at the same time. The first round of attacks, between March 16 and March 26, directly targeted GreatFire's Amazon CloudFront instances in an attempt to either cause Amazon to remove these instances or simply run up GreatFire's hosting costs. Although this significantly affected GreatFire's bill, it failed to block the services and GreatFire responded with some technical changes to mitigate the attack. But GreatFire's CloudFront domains aren't memorable, so those in China who wish to discover one need another source. GreatFire uses Github for this, hosting both instructions for evading the Great Firewall and directions on obtaining a copy of the Chinese language New York Times. Previously, China tried blocking GitHub but quickly relented when local developers objected. So the Great Cannon's operator switched the target, instructing newly hijacked web browsers to repeatedly contact GitHub. This attack persisted until April 7, although GitHub was able to mitigate this attack after the first few days. Since then, the Great Cannon has gone silent; we have not detected any further attempts to use this device. While it still ran, we were able to isolate the Cannon's location, showing that it wasn't a group of hacker vigilantes but a dedicated tool that shares code and network location with the Great Firewall.  We don't expect that hackers would have access to the Great Firewall's source code or be able to install devices in the backbone of the Chinese Internet across multiple Internet providers. Combined with the choice of targets, the Great Cannon is almost certainly a tool of the Chinese government. Though the Great Cannon has gone silent, the dangerous implications remain. To start with, China seemed willing to explicitly attack a U.S. company, GitHub, in an attempt to suppress online content that the Chinese government finds objectionable. It would also be a trivial change for the Great Cannon's operator to turn the Cannon into a direct exploitation tool, targeting web servers directly. Instead of replacing content with the instructions to execute a DOS attack, the replaced content instead could exploit the target's browser to take over the target's computer. Combined with some target awareness and a minor change to the Cannon itself, the Chinese could use this to hack any web browser -- if the Chinese can identify their target's IP address and the target happens to fetch unencrypted content hosted from within China. The Great Cannon was also a direct attack on Baidu. For everyone outside of China, any page containing an unencrypted Baidu service, even something as innocuous as an advertisement, now may be a vehicle for a Chinese government attack. And although the Cannon primarily replaced content served by Baidu, it can just as easily target any other Chinese service. Anyone concerned with the possibility of Chinese government hacking now needs to consider the entire Chinese Internet as explicitly hostile. How can Chinese Internet companies hope to compete?  Although China's use of the Great Cannon to censor content is objectionable, if China instead chooses to use this to directly exploit computers, they would have company. According to recent revelations, the NSA in the United States and the GCHQ in the United Kingdom have developed and deployed an attack using similar techniques that they have used against Belgacom, Belgium's primary telecommunications provider. The Internet is now a hostile place. If an adversary sees your unencrypted traffic, it is not just a data leak but an attack vector they can use to exploit your computer. Encryption isn't just a matter of privacy but a necessity for self-defense.  </corpo>

            <descricao>China defends building artificial islands in the South China Sea, saying land reclamation in contested waters is "justified, legitimate and reasonable."</descricao>
            <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)China has defended building artificial islands in contested waters in the South China Sea, saying the land reclamation is "justified, legitimate and reasonable." Adm. Sun Jianguo told a regional defense forum in Singapore Sunday that the construction did not target any other countries or affect the freedom of navigation, according to comments carried by state broadcaster CCTV. "I want to reaffirm that this construction is well within the scope of China's sovereignty and it is justified, legitimate and reasonable," said Sun, the deputy chief of General Staff Department of the People's Liberation Army. "In spite of the sufficient historical and legal evidence and its indisputable claims of rights and interests, China has exercised enormous restraint, making positive contributions to peace and stability of the region and the world at large," he added. Sun's comments came a day after U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter singled out China as a source of instability in the region and called for "an immediate and lasting halt" to island building. "The United States is deeply concerned about the pace and scope of land reclamation in the South China Sea, the prospect of further militarization as well as the potential for these activities to increase the risk of miscalculation or conflict among claimant states," Carter said at the annual meeting, which is known as the Shangri-La Dialogue.  Anger has simmered over the South China Sea among China and neighboring countries, such as Vietnam and the Philippines, which have argued about existing territorial claims and the natural resources that lie beneath them. Last month, a U.S. surveillance plane carrying a CNN crew flew over such artificial islands, triggered eight warnings from the Chinese navy to back off. U.S. officials are concerned about China's militarization of some of the islands and are trying to create public awareness of it, but Chinese media slammed the issue as being manufactured and "sensationalized on purpose" by the West. While other countries have also reclaimed land in the disputed waters, Carter said that China had "gone much further and faster" -- reclaiming more than 2,000 acres in the past 18 months. And China has placed artillery pieces on one of its manufactured islands, a U.S. official said Friday. Responding to audience questions at the forum, Sun said that no decision had been reached on whether China would set up an Air Defense Identification Zone in the South China Sea, and such a move would depend on whether "China's air and maritime security" is threatened. In 2013, China declared an air defense zone in the East China Sea that covered islands disputed by China and Japan, eliciting strong criticisms from Japan and its close ally the U.S. However, Sun also sought to play down the tensions, stressing that China was committed to resolving the South China Sea dispute peacefully.

            <descricao>A tough new ban on smoking indoors rolls out across the China's capital, with lighting up now prohibited in all offices, restaurants, bars and airports. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)A tough new ban on smoking indoors rolls out across the Chinese capital Monday, with lighting up now prohibited in all offices, shopping malls, restaurants, bars and airports. Many outdoor public places such as the areas outside kindergartens and hospitals will also be required to be smoke-free. Businesses and institutions that flout the law will face fines of up to 10,000 yuan ($1,600) and repeat offenders could have their licenses revoked. Bernhard Schwartländer, the World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Beijing, says it's a "major advance" in tobacco control in China, where more cigarettes are smoked than anywhere else in the world. Here's five things to know as China battles its "smoking dragon."  It's not the first time Beijing has tried to tackle its smoking problem -- a previous ban launched in 2008 was widely ignored. After closing them with great fanfare, the airport quietly reopened the smoking rooms in its terminals. However, unlike previous efforts, this law has teeth -- flouters will face stringent fines. Individuals must pay 200 yuan ($32) (up from 10 yuan ($1.60)) and businesses risk a penalty of up to 10,000 yuan ($1,600). Anyone who breaks the law three times will find themselves named and shamed on a government website. Schwartländer at the WHO says effective enforcement in a city the size of Beijing will be a "colossal task" but the law "deserves to be regarded as a major step forward in the battle against the smoking dragon."  China is home to some 300 million smokers and some four million live in Beijing. More than one in every three cigarettes in the world is smoked in China. And those cigarettes are cheap -- as little as $1.50 for a popular brand like Zhongnanhai. According to the Tobacco Atlas, 26% of the price of a packet of cigarettes is tax, compared with a WHO benchmark of 75%. The China National Tobacco Corp makes one third of the world's cigarettes and is a state-run monopoly responsible for 3.6 million farmers, four million tobacco retailers and half a million related employees. Health authorities have, until now perhaps, been reluctant to take on the interests of a giant industry.  Northern China's smog-ridden skies have been linked to 1.2 million premature deaths a year but smoking is arguably a far more pressing health problem. According to the WHO, the city's concentration of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers -- known as PM2.5 -- can often reach 500 or more. While this dwarfs the WHO's recommended exposure of below 25 -- the smoke from just three cigarettes burning in a restaurant can result in a level of 600. "The smoke from 20 or more smokers, which is not unfeasible in a crowded bar or restaurant, will result in a PM2.5 level that will be off the chart," says Schwartländer, writing in The Lancet.  Smoking is a handy icebreaker in China, a way to greet someone and few interactions aren't made easier by offering a cigarette. Until an edict by President Xi Jinping in 2013, it was common for government officials to have a cigarette in hand while performing their public duties. Chairman Mao Zedong and paramount leader Deng Xiaoping were renowned smokers. While the new ban will limit tobacco advertising, it might already be too late for the next generation. In 2013, a WHO survey found that among five to six year old children, almost nine in 10 can recognize at least one brand of cigarettes and one in five expect to be smokers when they grow up.  Some 45% of men smoke daily, according to 2013 figures, compared with just 2.1% of women -- this means that Chinese women endure some of the highest rates of exposure to second hand smoke in the world. It's hoped that this army of female non-smokers might prove to be a secret weapon in enforcing the new ban. At an event in Beijing on Sunday, groups of school girls and older women danced outside the "Bird's Nest" Olympic stadium, which was draped in anti-smoking banners. But new data shows that while the overall smoking rate has declined in the past decade, there has been a "significant increase" in women lighting up.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Breed now, or see your kind die out with you. With extinctions raging at a maddening clip, more and more species face this alternative. The Yangtze giant softshell turtle is the one of the latest, and scientists are going to desperate measures to help it reproduce. There is only one known female left in the world, and they recently artificially inseminated her. But she's about 100 years old, and scientists are not sure she'll have children, the Wildlife Conservation Society said. "The conservation world will once again be holding its collective breath until we know if this was successful," said zoo biologist Rick Hudson from Fort Worth, Texas. He joined a team of scientists who traveled to China to try to save the species, known scientifically as Rafetus swinhoei. They've failed before.  Keepers had previously already put the female together with a male in a Chinese zoo. He is one of the last three known males of the species. The two turtles looked like they were mating. Then she laid eggs. But they were nonviable. They had not been fertilized. A closer look at the male's genitals revealed they'd been damaged -- possibly in a fight with another male decades before. To get semen out of them, the scientists would have to go the extra mile. They stimulated him by hand, and with a vibrator, but no luck. So they used an electric current. At his age -- also about 100 years -- electro-ejaculation was a life-threatening prospect. But it worked.  Then the team injected the semen into the female, and eggs began to form. The scientists won't know if this batch is fertilized, until hatching time. The turtle is due to lay in a few weeks. There may not be too many second chances. In the fall, zoo keepers will separate the female and take her back to her home zoo. "We hope some children move together with her," said the zoo's Vice Director Yan Xiahui. A few weeks after she lays, the team should know more about this species' fragile chance of survival or get closer to the certainty that when the last of these four turtles dies, their entire species will vanish forever. It's a repeat tragedy. When giant tortoise Lonesome George died three years ago on the Galapagos Island of Pinta at the age of 100, he took his species with him. The northern white rhino in Kenya is in a similar bind, except that there is only one male left in its subspecies. So far, he has failed to produce offspring with his two female companions.  As human populations have expanded exponentially and developed the need for more land and consumption, the rate of extinction of other species has soared. A study last year put the rate at 100 extinctions per year for every 1,000,000 species on the planet. That's about 1,000 times higher than the rate before human populations spread. The extinction rate particularly rocketed as industrialization has spread. The World Wildlife Fund says the extinction rate could be much higher than the study indicates. And if the highest estimates about the number of species on Earth are true -- that we live among 100,000,000 species -- they would be currently dying off at a rate of at least 10,000 species per year, perhaps even 100,000. Some scientists believe we may be living in one of the greatest periods of extinction in the history of life on our planet. Last male northern white rhino under guard 24 hours  </corpo>

            <descricao>The standoff between the U.S. and China over disputed territory in the South China Sea is escalating into a war of words and military maneuvers in the area.</descricao>
            <corpo>Washington (CNN)China has placed artillery pieces on one of the islands it is manufacturing in contested waters in the South China Sea, a U.S. official told CNN Friday. The story was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. The official added that the artillery pieces are no longer visible -- having either been removed or concealed -- following a U.S. Navy P8-A Poseidon surveillance mission over the area. CNN was on board the flight, which took place last week. READ: Exclusive: China warns U.S. surveillance plane Amidst the Chinese military buildup, Washington and Beijing are engaging in a war of words over the disputed South China Sea territory, with pledges of military maneuvers in the area. "China urges the U.S., think three times before taking action; act responsibly; stop all provocative speech and acts; and do more things that will benefit the region's peace and stability instead of the opposite," Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said Thursday. The comments came after U.S. Defense Secretary Ashton Carter began an important trip to the Pacific region, during which he vowed that the U.S. would not back down on its military operations around islands China is manufacturing in disputed waters 600 miles from its coastline "There should be no mistake: The United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows, as we do all around the world," Carter said Wednesday. In response, China's foreign ministry demanded the U.S. use caution. "What kind of function can the U.S. have for the region's peace and prosperity?" the foreign ministry spokesman asked. "Fundamentally speaking, would creating a mess in the Asia Pacific, which is the core engine of the world economy, fit the U.S. interests?" READ: Behind the scenes: A secret Navy flight over China's military buildup Last week, the Chinese Navy repeatedly issued warnings during the P8's mission. The crew answered each radio challenge with the same response: that the U.S. was flying in international airspace over international waters. In his comments at a change of command ceremony in Hawaii for U.S. military forces in the Pacific, Carter said it is not only the U.S. that supports a continued American military presence in the region, but also nervous Southeast Asian nations, some of whom, including Vietnam and close U.S. ally the Philippines, have competing claims for islands and reefs in the South China Sea. "China's actions are bringing countries in the region together in new ways," Carter said. "And they're increasing demand for American engagement in the Asia-Pacific. We're going to meet it. We will remain the principal security power in the Asia-Pacific for decades to come."  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Chinese tennis star Li Na has given birth to a baby girl. The child, named Alisa, was born at 2:25 a.m on Wednesday, according to a tweet from her management company IMG Tennis. "Welcome to the world, baby Alisa!" the company tweeted, with a photo of a beaming Li holding her baby, with her smiling husband and former tennis coach, Dennis. The child is the couple's first. Li, Asia's only grand slam champion, announced she was expecting in January. Li retired from competitive tennis last year due to a nagging knee injury. She won the French (2011) and the Australian Open (2014) to become the highest ranked Asian player the world has ever seen, peaking at No. 2 in the world. Li posted an image of Alisa's footprint to her followers on Chinese microblogging site Weibo, which was picked up by state media.  CNN's Shen Lu contributed to this report from Beijing. </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)The women's national team is the toast of China after recording the country's first World Cup victory since 2007. Wang Lisi's 91st-minute winner was enough for her side to scrape past the Netherlands Thursday in a match it dominated from start to finish. China has enjoyed relative success since the inception of the Women's World Cup in 1991, reaching the quarterfinals on three occasions -- two of those coming when it hosted the tournament in 1991 and 2007. Its best ever finish was a runner-up spot in the 1999 edition of the competition when it lost out on penalties to the United States. This is in stark contrast to the men's national team, which has qualified for just one World Cup -- in 2002 -- and lost all three games that year without scoring a goal. The women's team suffered an opening-day defeat at the hands of host Canada last week and exacted redemption of sorts with its own injury-time winner against the Netherlands. The victory leaves China tied on three points with Thursday's opponent -- one behind group leader Canada, who played out a storm-interrupted goalless draw with New Zealand later that night. "We created lots of scoring opportunities," China coach Hao Wei told FIFA's official website. "Our players were under a lot of pressure after losing the first match. Today they showcased their true abilities and I am so proud of them. "We should have scored more, although this team is very young and lacks international experience. However, they executed the game plan well and I'm delighted with their performance."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>China: Brave new world for spy thrillers? - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>China, a land of surveillance and increasing military might, is turning into a writer's paradise for those with a thriller to tell. </descricao>
            <corpo>London (CNN)China, a land of surveillance and increasing military might, is turning into a writer's paradise for those with a thriller to tell. Western authors say its rise has been pure gold for suspense novels, filling a gaping hole left by the end of the Cold War. China has its own pack of spy novelists too. "The mysterious side of China certainly lends itself to thriller writing," says novelist Adam Brookes. The second installment of his critically acclaimed Night Heron trilogy, a spy yarn set between China and the UK, will debut this month. "Consider: China has emerged as a global power, yet we do not know how Xi Jinping engineered his rise to the leadership. We barely understand the country's core mechanisms!" he says. "So we spy, to find out. And suddenly you have all sorts of dramatic possibilities." In August, Mai Jia, nicknamed China's John le Carré, sees the UK publication of "In the Dark" -- his follow up to his codebreaking and counterespionage novel "Decoded." These are just the latest developments in a wider publishing tale: a growing interest in Asia, and in particular China, as a setting for tales of intrigue.  After the Cold War, writers spent years mourning the loss of old enemies and looking for new ones. They flirted with corporations and took on the Middle East. Yet they struggled to find something that really stuck. "It was easy for le Carré and people like that -- they had Russia. They were the obvious enemy," says Paul French, author of murder mystery "Midnight in Peking." Enter China, a former Cold War foe, which remains Communist by name and secretive by nature and it's no surprise that a growing number of acclaimed spy writers are traveling east in search of inspiration. Charles McCarry, one of the U.S.' most respected writers of spy fiction chose China for his 2013 hit: "The Shanghai Factor." It follows a young U.S. agent and his relationship with a mysterious woman named Mei, who is supposedly working for Chinese intelligence. The novel works both as light entertainment and as a more serious metaphor of the increasingly complicated relationship between China and the U.S.  For some, China's characteristic imperviousness is a major obstacle. Can foreign writers get the level of access needed for a great spy novel? "They won't even let foreigners into the Beijing naval museum without a Chinese ID card!" says French. For others, its impenetrable nature is a playground. U.S. journalist Alex Berenson, who set his second spy novel "The Ghost War" on a conflict between the US and China, admitted he left China without a deep understanding of Chinese Communist Party protocol. "Those doors stayed closed to me, as they do to nearly all Westerners," he wrote in the New York Times. "But the opacity that maddens the reporters is manna for novelists, and the novelist in me had a fine time imagining what might be happening behind closed doors in Beijing." China's weird and widely popular workplace novels  Contemporary Chinese writers are catching on too. For Charlotte Middlehurst, books editor at Time Out China, this represents a significant departure from the past. While thrillers, in particular detective stories, have long been popular in China (Agatha Christie and Sherlock Holmes are big hits), Chinese writers have penned few themselves. "Up until recently the number of foreigners writing spy thrillers set in China has far outweighed that of local writers," Middlehurst says. Not anymore. China now has its own pack-- Xiaolong Qui and He Jiahong for example. "They, along with other writers, most notably Mai Jia, have taken the thriller genre and added Chinese characteristics turning it into something altogether more unique." Middlehurst attributes the trend partly to the rise of social media, which has facilitated online fanzines and reader communities. She also believes President Xi's recent crackdown on corruption "has resonated deeply with readers and authors" as previously off bound topics have become more openly talked about. READ: Profiting from China's banned books  Not all are convinced that China will become literary villain number one though. Spy fiction in the UK and U.S. at least is still dominated by tried-and-tested tropes. Readers like established archetypes. And foreign language books generally struggle to reach these audiences, not least books from or set in China. The culture remains confusing, the history unexplored and the language totally baffling. "When the landscape is so unfamiliar, many readers are wary of plunging into it," says Brookes. "I have tried with "Night Heron" to walk the commercial fiction reader into China and keep them oriented, but it's a hard trick to pull off." "And I think many thriller writers will see renewed strategic rivalries with Russia, the threat of global jihadism and terrorism as more accessible sources of locale and plot," he says. Despite this Brookes is optimistic. "China is the great strategic story of our time, and everybody should be making some effort to get to grips with it," he says. If China doesn't yet have a license to thrill, it's only a matter of time.

            <cabecalho>China to its drivers: Rein in your road rage - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>New drivers in China must take a course in being "safe and civilized" as authorities attempt to address a rise in road rage.</descricao>
            <corpo>Beijing (CNN)On the sprawling ground of Beijing Gongjiao Driving School, hundreds of white Volkswagen sedans crawled at a snail's pace as students behind the wheels practiced starting, turning and parking their cars one recent afternoon. "When students become impatient because of the long queue, I tell them to consider this a preview of Beijing's traffic jams," said Geng Guizhi, a veteran instructor at the school, where as many as 10,000 people sign up in a single month. "I tell them, you have to remain calm and patient." That message is more relevant and important than ever, as roads in major Chinese cities become increasingly congested, creating a lot of frustration and anger -- as well as grave danger -- on the streets. Thanks to continued rapid economic growth, government statistics show a 20% jump in private car ownership in 2014 -- to 105 million cars nationwide. The World Health Organization has estimated that more than 200,000 people die on the roads of China every year. From the beginning of 2012 to the end of April this year, police linked 104 million traffic violations to some form of road rage, ranging from forcibly changing lanes or overtaking other vehicles, to failing to yield.  The past few weeks, state media have reported several egregious examples of road rage across China. In early May, a BMW car driven by a young woman collided with a bus in the eastern city of Xuzhou when she tried to change lane. During an ensuing argument, the woman asked two male friends to assault the bus driver -- and then verbally abused traffic policemen upon their arrival. During the same week, a Mercedes-Benz car driver ran over and killed an elderly man in the southwestern city of Kunming, after the driver tried to cut in line at a toll booth and got into an argument with the victim's family. One of the most disturbing incidents was caught on camera on May 3, as a high-speed chase between two cars in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu only ended when the male driver forced the female driver ahead of him to stop under an elevated highway. What happened next shocked and outraged the nation: He dragged her out of the car, threw her to the ground and viciously beat her -- showing no mercy even when she tried to escape.  Public opinion shifted, however, when dashcam footage from the male driver's car emerged. That video, taken before the incident, showed the female driver cutting in front of him at the last second to take a nearly missed highway exit. Many of the woman's sympathizers online turned against her, stirring a national debate on drivers behaving badly and road rage -- with thousands of comments calling reckless driving as appalling as wanton violence. The female driver, who suffered concussion and fractures, has since apologized in an open letter, while the male driver remains behind bars pending a police investigation. "No matter what she did, he should have never resorted to violence," said Liang Di, 28, an office worker in Beijing taking her first driving lesson at the Gongjiao School. "But I also feel the woman driver wasn't blameless -- everything has two sides."  Under the watchful eyes of her instructor, Liang meticulously practiced the steps of starting a manual-shift car. Like the nearly 28 million people who received a new driver's license last year, she also had to sit through a class on how to become a "safe and civilized driver." The class and a mandatory test on the subject are all part of the government's effort to nip the problems of bad drivers and road rage in the bud, as the authorities tighten traffic rules and increase penalties for violators. "Offensive driving caused by road rage is a severe violation of law that disrupts traffic order and endangers safety," said the Ministry of Public Security in a statement after the Chengdu incident. "Drivers should consciously overcome their road rage." Traffic police departments in cities like Beijing even produce nightly television shows that air on local channels, highlighting the potentially deadly consequences of road rage through footage of horrific accidents. Just outside the orderly "streets" of the Beijing driving school one recent evening, the authorities' message appeared to have fallen on deaf ears in the real world as motorists, cyclists and pedestrians fought for space, amid the constant sound of honking and braking. For now, the law of the jungle -- anything goes -- still seems to rule the streets of China, with millions of new cars and news drivers hitting the road every year that may add to the chaos, anger and danger.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Every year, Hong Kong holds the world's largest mass gathering to commemorate the Tiananmen Square crackdown. But this year will be different.</descricao>
            <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)Tens of thousands of people dressed in black. A sea of candlelight. The roar of pro-democracy anthems sung in Chinese. Every year, Hong Kong holds the world's largest annual mass gathering to commemorate the Tiananmen Square crackdown. But after sprawling pro-democracy protests put the city at bitter odds with China last fall, this year's anniversary takes on a different meaning. Here's our guide to understanding the significance of June 4 for China and Hong Kong, and what may happen next.  In the spring of 1989, thousands of Chinese students marched into Beijing's Tiananmen Square to call for democracy. Following weeks of peaceful protests, troops acted on the orders of Chinese Communist Party leaders to open fire on civilians and students in the early hours of June 4, ending the mass demonstrations. Though no official figure has been announced, the death toll is estimated to range from several hundred to thousands. Read: Tiananmen Square facts  Chinese censors have blocked the search results of "June 4" and "Tiananmen Square" on the Internet. If mentioned at all in textbooks and campuses, the crackdown is described as an "incident" or a "counterrevolutionary riot" that deserved to be suppressed. Last month, a Chinese student studying abroad penned an open letter, co-signed by 10 other overseas Chinese students, calling for students in mainland China to discuss the Tiananmen Square crackdown. A state-run Chinese newspaper quickly condemned the letter for "twisting the facts of 26 years ago with narratives of some overseas hostile forces."  Every year on June 4, many Hong Kongers hold a massive candlelight vigil in Victoria Park to honor those killed in 1989 in Tiananmen Square. Some mainland Chinese people attend the vigil as well. The vigil is also a expression of fierce discontent with the governments of China and Hong Kong as participants shout political slogans calling for the overthrow of the Chinese Communist Party and the resignation of Hong Kong's Beijing-backed chief executive. In recent years, the crowds have swelled in size as anxiety grows over China's increasing influence in Hong Kong, a former British colony. Last year, the world's first June 4 Memorial Museum opened in Hong Kong.  When Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997, the two countries agreed Hong Kong would enjoy a "high degree of autonomy" for 50 years and eventually develop an election system based on universal suffrage. But nobody agrees on what that actually means. Last year, China proposed letting Hong Kongers vote for their next leader -- as long as candidates are first approved by a small Beijing-backed committee. Infuriated by that proposal, pro-democracy Hong Kongers organized massive street protests that paralyzed parts of Hong Kong for 79 days last fall. Those demonstrations -- known as "Occupy" or the "Umbrella Movement" -- were ultimately dispersed by police but deepened rifts in the city and angered Beijing.  Last fall's Occupy movement birthed a new generation of young pro-democracy Hong Kongers who organize on the Internet, refuse to identify as Chinese and are eager for aggressive confrontation. They've lost patience with Hong Kong's older generation of activists, who identify with the movement for democracy in China but have failed to secure tangible democratic gains for Hong Kong. That's why some younger protesters are refusing to attend this year's mass vigil run by the older activists. Some of them see the goal of building a democratic China -- as implied by the remembrance of Tiananmen -- as a distraction from their struggle for democracy in Hong Kong.  In just a few weeks, Hong Kong legislators are expected to vote on the electoral reform proposed by Beijing. But pro-democracy lawmakers have just enough votes to veto the plan, which needs two-thirds majority to pass. Activists have threatened new protests and Beijing has not banned assemblies related to June 4 in Hong Kong. However, local authorities have made it clear that they will not tolerate Occupy-style demonstrations again. Meanwhile, rising housing prices and a growing wealth gap exacerbate discontent among many Hong Kongers. Local and international groups also say press freedom has declined dramatically in the city. No matter the vote's outcome, new confrontations within the increasingly fractured city are all but guaranteed. Distrust runs deep, and nobody has been able to come up with a compromise acceptable to all sides.  </corpo>

            <corpo>Beijing (CNN)Rarer than a panda, few people knew about the Ili pika until earlier this year when pictures of China's "magic bunny" went viral after being featured in a series of news reports. But now the tiny and endangered mammal is finding out the price of fame. Conservationist Li Weidong, who discovered the species in 1983, lamented the lack of funding for his conservation efforts when first interviewed by CNN in March. READ: Meet China's 'magic rabbit' He's since been able to raise almost $28,000 on a Chinese crowd-funding website, enough to fund his research and conservation efforts for the next year. But Li told CNN this week that the tiny mammal now faces other threats. People have tried to catch the pika, wanting one as a pet. Companies have offered Li funding to catch the pika and then artificially breed them, Li said. "Ili pikas, as alpine animals, can't adapt to the environment at low elevations without special facilities," he said. "Would they survive? Their population is already small enough. Human capture will accelerate the extinction." Fearing that cameras might disturb pikas, Li said he has also turned away a dozen more photographers who hoped accompany him on his field research in the Tianshan mountains.  Native to the Xinjiang region of northwestern China, there are fewer than 1,000 of these creatures living in the Tianshan mountain range in the region, Li said. Li discovered the pika, formally known as Ochotona iliensis, and named it after his hometown, Ili. A year ago, Li spotted and photographed the elusive creature for the first time since the early 1990s. He estimates its numbers have declined by almost 70% since its discovery. In 2008, the animal was listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature but there's no official organization or team dedicated studying or protecting it, according to Li. For years, Li has called for Ili Pika to be listed on China's List of Wildlife under Special State Protection -- part of the country's 1988 Wildlife Protection Law. The appeal seems more urgent now as more people have laid eyes on the it, Li said. Li said he is in negotiation with authorities in Jinghe County, where many Ili Pikas were discovered, for the establishment of a nature reserve to keep people away from the rare animals.  In late May, Li led a team of five volunteers to collect video footage from infrared cameras set up last August. Some 30 infrared cameras captured about 16 video clips of the Pika from the two areas over the past 10 months. Li said the video clips showed that pikas communicate with each other through their own urine traces and bodily waste. "They can tell by sniffing whether another pika is nearby. If it is a member of the opposite sex, they find a mate. If it is within its own gender, they claim territory." However, Li didn't find any pikas in the two sites where he spotted and photographed the elusive creature in July last year. He said this doesn't mean there are fewer pikas now as footage from one more area is yet to be collected and the cameras only covered half of the census areas. Yet it still worries him, he said. "We don't know whether it's because the animals didn't come out during the winter, or they were eaten by natural enemies or they died." To collect more accurate and complete information, Li said he plans to buy more infrared cameras with the recently raised money and set them up in all six areas.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Spectacular, rarely seen images of China's railways - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>From a part-time rail buff to a full-fledged photographer, Wang Wei runs all over China to capture stunning train photos.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)China's rail system is one enormous mass of statistics. It's 120,000 kilometers long (second largest in the world after the United States) and has the highest passenger-per-kilometer ratio in the world -- 1,060 billion passengers in 2013, according to the National Railway Administration of China). But for one Beijing-based "photoworm" -- as photographers are dubbed in China -- it's far more beautiful than a bunch of big numbers. Wang Wei, 25, is possibly the most passionate rail fan in China. Over the past decade he's braved frostbite, unreliable timetables and months away from home while traveling an estimated 300,000 kilometers to capture the country's rail network and its trains in pictures. It's been more than two years since CNN interviewed the then recent university graduate and railway obsessive. Since then, Wang has become a mini-celebrity. He's been interviewed by more than 20 Chinese and overseas media outlets, and even been the subject of a Chinese television documentary. What's more, he has two books being published in China later this year. "Zhui Huo Che" (Running After Trains) is a photo book featuring his experiences and photography techniques. "My Jing-Zhang Railway" is an illustrated book showcasing Wang's photos and interviews with people who have worked and lived on the Beijing-Zhangjiangkou line, China's first Chinese-designed and built railway. "Chinese official have seldom promoted the beauty of the railway and trains," says Wang. "They have never taken pictures of what I've been taken. "Instead, they take photos of leaders delivering a speech, cutting ribbons. "I feel the railway belongs to each of us, everyone has the responsibility to promote it if they love it." CNN: It's been two years since we last talked. Where have you been lately? Wang Wei: The 200-kilometer Southern Xinjiang Railway (Tianshan Mountain section) stopped running in February 2015, so I brought my dad and three friends there last December. It was really cold in Southern Xinjiang in December -- around minus 30C (minus 22F). Even worse, we were told there were wolves in the area and they're very active at night, which was during my shooting times. We decided to dig a hole and burn branches inside. The fire helped us drive away the wolves and warm ourselves. Most important, I got the photos I want. I also visited Japan and Germany in the last two years. CNN: What impressed you the most during the trips? Wang: The railway culture of Japan and Germany moved me a lot. In Germany, they can buy the abandoned rails and trains for cheap, about RMB100,000 ($16,110) for two compartments, which is around one-tenth of the price in China. They (often) retain the original look of their rail cars and turn them into hostels and restaurants. Really lovely. In Japan, when I took photos of the trains, the staff was friendly and gave me useful instructions like where to get the good angles and so on. This is impossible in China. Here the staff will only tell you go away. You can also see quite a number of books featuring railways in Japan. We have very limited materials on railways in China. The length of China's railway system is the second longest in the world, and the history of Chinese railways is more than 100 years old. I really wish the culture of the Chinese railways can catch up. CNN: How did you get into railway photography? Wang: I am a Beijing native and grew up by a train station. I started taking railway photos in 2005 when I was 15. I have a deep connection with the trains and railways. From my window (in my home), I can see trains every day. The first photos I took were of trains at Beijing North Railway Station, which is next to my place. CNN: What's the secret of a good railroad photo? Wang: I usually make a plan two or three days before shooting. According to the train schedule, color and type, I will think about light and background -- should it be directly light or back lit, things like that. It's actually not too complicated. CNN: Which have been your favorites places? Wang: The Greater Khingan Mountains. The Qinghai-Tibet extension rail. South of Xinjiang. And the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway's China section. CNN: Any new trends in the train industry you've noticed? Wang: The new high-speed trains are a growing influence everywhere. In my eyes, the new trains aren't as beautiful as old locomotives. However, from a passenger's perspective, it's good to enhance the speed. CNN: What equipment do you use? Wang: A Nikon D800 and a 28-300 VR lens. It usually happens all of a sudden -- the train comes and there's no extra time for me to change lenses so I need a multiple-use, long-haul lens like that. CNN: How do you travel to your destinations? Wang: I use every form of transportation depending on where I go. Trains and cars half of the time, and on foot the other half. During my trip to northeast China in October 2011, I walked more than 186 kilometers in 15 days, not including the mountains I climbed. It was the only way I could reach the places I wanted to go. CNN: How long do your photo expeditions usually take? Wang: Depends where I go -- the journey usually takes from 10 days to a month. The longest journey I took was a 56-day trip covering seven provinces -- Beijing, Gansu, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Shannxi, Yunnan and Guizhou in the summer of 2011. CNN: Any difficulties during any of your missions? Wang: To me, the difficulties are finding angles and waiting for trains. I love the high angle, so I usually climb mountains to take photos. Some of the mountains are steep and have dangerous wildlife, like snakes. So I need to be very careful. At night, it's even harder to climb. The trains often change schedules according to the weather or other unpredictable reasons, so it's quite normal for me to wait in one spot a whole day without seeing a train. CNN: Is your family supportive? Wang: Like many Chinese parents, they thought I should go to college and get a degree. So at first they didn't support me at all. But when they heard the experiences of my journeys and saw my photos were getting better and better, they were OK with it. My dad sometimes will join me on photo shoots.

            <descricao>The highest-ranking Chinese Communist Party official ever to face corruption charges was sentenced Thursday to life in prison, China's top court says. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The highest-ranking Chinese Communist Party official ever to face corruption charges has been sentenced to life in prison, according to a statement Thursday from China's Supreme People's Court. Zhou Yongkang, the country's former security chief, received the sentence after being found guilty of taking bribes, China's top court said, citing the Tianjin No. 1 Intermediate People's Court in northeastern China. Zhou, 72, also received seven years for abusing power and four years for deliberately revealing state secrets. Footage from the court in Tianjin, not far from the Chinese capital, Beijing, showed Zhou looking healthy but now with white hair. He said, "I have acknowledged the fact of my committed crimes, and the loss that was caused to the party's mission. Hereby I am pleading guilty and I am regretful of it." As a member of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee -- China's top decision-making body -- Zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people. He retired in 2012. At the height of his power, Zhou controlled police forces, spy agencies, court systems and prosecution offices across China -- and wasn't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of "preserving social stability." But prosecutors said Zhou took advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and illegally accepted large amounts of money during his long political career. State media have painted an intricate web of officials, cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around Zhou before the crumbling of his power structure last summer. He was expelled from the Communist Party and arrested in December before being formally charged in April. Zhou and his family members were said to have accumulated enormous wealth in a blatant exchange between money and power. He was also found to have affairs with multiple women and allegedly traded power for sex, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported last year. Analysts have viewed his shocking downfall as a watershed moment in the secretive world of Chinese politics, now ruled by President Xi Jinping. Xi has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign, targeting both "tigers" and "flies" -- high-ranking, and low-level, officials. Who is Zhou Yongkang? CNN's Steven Jiang reported and wrote from Beijing, and CNN's Jason Hanna wrote in Atlanta. CNN's David McKenzie and Kevin Wang contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Chinese feminists show off armpit hair in photo contest - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>In the fight against domestic violence and gender inequality, Chinese feminists have opened up a new battlefront: Their armpits. </descricao>
            <corpo>Beijing (CNN)In the fight against domestic violence and gender inequality, Chinese feminists have opened up a new battlefront: Their armpits. They ask, why should women have to shave their pits when men are never expected to? To subvert the double standard, feminist Xiao Meili, 25, started an armpit hair photo contest on Chinese social network Weibo. Dozens of women have participated, including three of the five feminists briefly arrested in March over a protest for gender equality. The participants sent in selfies and glamor shots with their arms proudly raised, revealing natural hair underneath. "Women should have the right to decide how to deal with their bodies, including small details like armpit hair," Xiao tells CNN. "You can choose to shave it, but you shouldn't be forced to do so under the pressure of stereotypes." Six winners will be selected from the photo competition, which ends Wednesday. Prizes include condoms, vibrators and a pedestal urinal that a woman can use while standing.  Xiao, who became a feminist in college after reading female authors like Simone de Beauvoir, says the aesthetics of silky smooth armpits didn't become popular in China until around 20 years ago, as American influences swept into the country. Before that, nobody thought showing armpit hair was an issue. As a small child, Xiao recalled her mother's indifference over armpit hair. "She said, 'I don't have much of it. Plus it will eventually shed years later. Why would I bother removing it?'" These days, shaving has become the norm for China women -- but it's not right, says Xiao. "The media coverage on female celebrities' underarms is disgusting, as if women shouldn't have hair or it's something to be ashamed of, while male celebrities openly show off their armpit hair." As one participant says beneath her photo submission: "I love my armpit hair. It's part of my body. I hope girls can show off their armpit hair without fear."  To Xiao, concern over the armpit hair issue isn't trivial -- it's a matter of principle. "Some people question why I make a fuss about the hair. They say there are more important issues that need to be solved like domestic violence and sexual assault. I think they are equally important. They're all about fighting for gender equality." Xiao has tackled other issues concerning women. Last year, she walked more than 1,200 miles across China, sending letters to officials in each city she visited to raise awareness of sex abuse in Chinese schools. Before that, she has staged public art performances to protest everything from violence against women to unfair ratios of male-to-female public restrooms. But it hasn't been easy. In March, five of her friends, fellow activists, were detained after planning a protest in Beijing to counter sexual harassment on public transportation. They were only released a month later after news had spread around the world, leading even Hillary Clinton to condemn the arrests.  Although China's current regime was founded on values of gender equality -- Mao Zedong banned old practices such as the binding of women's feet, and famously declared "In China, women hold up half the sky," -- women in today's China face violence and discrimination. According to a 2013 U.N. report, over half of men surveyed in China said they had committed an act of violence against a woman, and over one-fifth confessed to raping a woman. At the same time, women face extreme pressure to marry early, or else risk becoming a "leftover woman." Women who remain single, or fall outside beauty standards, are mocked as "manly women" -- sometimes on national television. And women remain underrepresented in leadership fields: No woman has ever reached China's Standing Committee, the country's highest-ranking political body. No matter: Xiao says she is determined to see the fight through. "Gender discrimination exists wherever there are people," she says. "Something needs to be done. We want our voices heard."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Sex trade goes underground in China's 'sin city' - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>The go-go days of Dongguan's red light district might be over but it doesn't mean the sex industry has disappeared. Rather, the trade has gone underground.</descricao>
            <corpo>Dongguan, China (CNN)When Han Yulai, a businessman in Dongguan, a town in southern China's manufacturing heartland, had clients in town for a factory visit or trade fairs, he would always offer them what he calls the "Dongguan standard." In the evening, he'd take them to a KTV, a karaoke entertainment establishment often synonymous with sexual services. There, a "mamasan" -- a name given to a woman in charge of running businesses at brothels -- would line up a dozen young women, mainly Chinese but also Japanese, Korean and -- the most expensive of all -- Russians. "You choose one or two, sing and drink and have a bit of fun, and then go to a room upstairs for some 'business.' Not love, only business," said Han, who used a pseudonym as prostitution is illegal in China. Today, doing that type of business is becoming increasingly difficult. In February 2014, the government launched a crackdown on the sex trade in Dongguan, which has been dubbed China's "Sin City." More than 2,000 hotels, saunas and massage parlors that catered to the city's migrant workers and visiting buyers were shut down, according to state media. Thousands of people were arrested, including suspected operators and organizers of prostitution, alongside high-ranking officials and corrupt police officers. The city's vice mayor, who was also head of the city's public security bureau, Yan Xiaokang, was removed from his posts. The raids lasted several months and their impact is still being felt more than a year later.  Indeed, at my hotel, a four-star establishment in the heart of Houjie, one of the red light districts, the massage and sauna floor still remain closed. So are spas and KTV facilities at other hotels in the area that I visited. On the streets, not one single "xiaojie" -- the Chinese word for miss that's also slang for prostitute -- is to be seen. In barbershops, often a front for sex services, staff seem to actually focus on customers' hair and nothing else. Lin Jiang, a professor of public finance and taxation at Sun Yat-Sen University in Guangzhou, estimated that the raids could wipe out out 50 billion yuan ($8 billion) for businesses, including hotels, shops and restaurants. That's a tenth of Dongguan's city revenue in 2014. He says it's impossible to know exactly what the financial losses were because officials have been too secretive. "We can only estimate, we can't get the data to prove it." Lin says the crackdown has caused financial pain in more ways than one. Dongguan's economy has traditionally relied on low-cost manufacturing. Efforts at growing high-end service industries and advanced manufacturing have been hampered by the high profile prostitution crackdown. "The anti-vice campaign has hurt the city's image and this shadow won't completely disappear," he told CNN. Han, the businessman, agrees. "We absolutely have fewer customers coming to Dongguan now than a year ago." READ: Police on alert after sex industry crackdown  But even if the go-go days of Dongguan's red light district are over, it doesn't mean the sex industry has disappeared. Rather, the trade has gone underground. Han can no longer openly take customers to KTVs or saunas for the "Dongguan standard," but there are ways of flying under the radar, he said, like having your own contacts with go-betweens and "mamasans." Getting contacts was far from difficult, as I experienced myself. Coming back to my hotel one night, I was approached by the lobby boy. "You like massage?" he asked with a cheeky smile. For 1,000 yuan ($160) I was offered 90 minutes in my room with "two beautiful Chinese girls." He gave me his number. Right before the lift doors closed, he winked at me and made a risqué hand gesture suggesting a type of sexual service. A hotel chauffeur also offered his services. As we were driving along a busy highway, he turned back to me and said "anmo, anmo?" -- massage in Chinese -- and made suggestive gestures with his fingers. I said I'd think about it and he gave me his business card. In less than a day, I had two local pimps at hand should their services be required.  Social media apps are also being used to connect supply and demand, especially China's mainstream instant messaging service WeChat. Since the women can't work at KTVs anymore, some of them instead linger around the building waiting for men to seek out their services. By searching "People nearby" and selecting "Female only" you get a list of WeChat users in the area. Looking at their profile pictures, it doesn't take much imagination to figure out who's in business. But using social media services is also getting increasingly difficult as China's Internet regulator is clamping down on sexual content. Chinese media reports that the sex trade is also believed to have shifted to one-on-one home service and phone appointments and on the streets during my visit, I didn't see any sex workers.  More than 250,000 sex workers were estimated to have worked in Dongguan before the government took action. Critics of the raids say the new underground environment has exposed sex workers to greater risks. "Sex workers have always been abused by the clients and the police. After the crackdown the situation is the same. They are still subject to violence from these to groups," said Ann Lee, a spokesperson for Zi Teng, a Hong Kong-based sex workers' rights group. Human Rights Watch said in a 2013 report that sex workers in China are subject to serious abuses, including police violence, arbitrary detention and coercive HIV testing. The police often fail to investigate crimes against sex workers by clients, it said. Global Times, a newspaper under the Chinese Communist Party mouthpiece the People's Daily, quoted people as saying the crackdown is hurting an already disadvantaged group, and raised the possibility of decriminalizing the industry, "as sexual freedom is arguably a human right." Lee hopes one day the sex trade could become "just one normal business activity" with healthier control and regulations. "But in China, that's just a dream. It's still too controversial," she added.  Most of the entertainment venues closed by police last year have been allowed to reopen and stricter rules took effect in April, according to Chinese media. The new rules include: Banning massages in private rooms with locked doors or lights turned off; identifying overnight guests to local police; and banning employees from offering services away from massage parlors. However, local pharmacies in red light districts continue to display ads for Viagra in their shop windows, with both original and ripoffs for sale. A pharmacist laughed when asked if there's still demand for the potency pills after the crackdown. "Yes," he said, "Especially at night time."

            <corpo>Beijing (CNN)At the height of his power, Zhou Yongkang controlled police forces, spy agencies, court systems and prosecution offices across China -- and the domestic security czar wasn't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of "preserving social stability." Before retiring in 2012, Zhou saw the domestic security budget swell to surpass that of the 2 million-strong Chinese military -- the world's largest. As a member of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee -- China's top decision-making body -- Zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people. Away from the spotlight, though, Zhou and his family members were reportedly taking advantage of his leadership position to accumulate enormous wealth. The allegedly blatant exchange between money and power, as revealed by China's state media, would eventually prompt Zhou's shocking downfall. He's the most senior official ever to face corruption charges in the history of the People's Republic of China.  After months of intense political rumors, the Communist Party's disciplinary arm in July announced a formal investigation into Zhou for "serious disciplinary violations." In December, state-run Xinhua news agency reported his arrest after the Communist leadership expelled him from the party. And in April, state prosecutors revealed he had been formally charged with accepting bribes, abuse of power and leaking state secrets. After a criminal trial held in Tianjin, a city near Beijing, he was sentenced to life in prison for taking bribes. Zhou, 72, also received seven years for abusing power and four years for deliberately revealing state secrets. Party investigators also accused Zhou of having affairs with multiple women, and trading power and money for sex. Read: China announces investigation into security czar  Many have viewed his fall from grace as a watershed moment in the secretive world of Chinese politics now ruled by President Xi Jinping. Xi has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign ostensibly targeting "tigers and flies" -- high-ranking and low-level officials alike. "The important thing here is that Xi has proven he's powerful enough to break this taboo of never incriminating former Politburo Standing Committee members," said longtime political analyst Willy Lam with the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Unlike Xi, who is "Communist royalty" thanks to his father's status as one of Mao Zedong's comrades in arms during the revolution, Zhou was born to a poor family in eastern China. His father was an illiterate farmer but borrowed money to send him to school. Smart and hardworking, Zhou didn't disappoint and went on to become one of the few local students admitted into an elite university in Beijing. That school, now called China University of Petroleum, was the cradle for titans in the state oil industry. After graduating with a degree in oil exploration, Zhou was assigned to an oil field in the country's northeast and rose through the official ranks from the late 1960s through the mid-1980s. Described by many as a capable and humble young party cadre, Zhou was remembered more for his political savviness than technical knowledge. His political skill shone when he was transferred to the oil ministry in Beijing, which later became a giant state-owned oil company and one of Zhou's power bases. Read: In China, 'everyone is guilty of corruption'  Overcoming factional wars in the ministry, Zhou was said to be a decisive leader who focused on expanding domestic oil exploration as well as overseas projects, a two-pronged strategy that would continue to this day. Fast growth of business abroad made supervision from Beijing harder, sowing the seeds for corruption. In 2001, after a stint as minister of land resources, Zhou was named the Communist Party chief of Sichuan, one of the country's most populous provinces. State media there portrayed Zhou as an eloquent leader with a clear vision, and gave him credit for luring high-tech companies, including Intel, to the southwestern province as well as modernizing the agriculture and tourism sectors. Zhou also developed strong local ties and planted officials loyal to him -- including secretaries he brought from Beijing -- in key postings throughout the province. Zhou's big break came in 2002 when he returned to Beijing and was put in charge of the ministry of public security, which runs the country's police forces. Five years later, he rose to the apex of power by taking a seat in the Politburo Standing Committee -- with an expanded portfolio that covered all domestic security affairs. His reign coincided with a time of mounting social and ethnic unrest as well as such major events as the Beijing Olympics in 2008, the 60th anniversary of the Communist rule in 2009 and the World Expo in Shanghai in 2010.  As the leadership prioritized security and stability above all else, Zhou greatly expanded police power at the expense of already-limited judicial independence, cementing his reputation as a ruthless hardliner among political dissidents and activists. It was also during this period that Zhou became a patron of Bo Xilai, a fast-rising political star who was waging a controversial war against organized crime in the southwestern metropolis of Chongqing. Bo's spectacular downfall in 2012 -- complete with tales of murder, bribery and betrayal -- attracted global attention. State media cited his subsequent conviction on corruption charges as a prime example of Xi's resolve to clean up the party. Read: Bo Xilai: From rising star to scandal Bo supporters, however, have long called him a political victim as the former high-flying politician was once considered Xi's main challenger for the top spot of Chinese leadership. Political activists and observers now note the similarity between the Bo and Zhou cases. "Zhou challenged Xi's authority and threatened his rule -- that's why he's now being held responsible along with his gangs," said Hu Jia, one of China's leading political dissidents, who was thrown into prison for more than three years on "subversion" charges when Zhou first took over nationwide law enforcement. "The bottom line is: All officials are corrupt," he added. "Xi can't find a better excuse to rid of his political opponents than fighting corruption -- something that helps him win the masses' hearts and minds." Lam, the Hong Kong analyst, said. "The people being investigated for corruption are on the losing side of factional struggles. People who are close to Xi are less liable to becoming incriminated."  Those close to Zhou have fallen with him. State media have reported official investigations -- and formal arrests in some cases -- of dozens of Zhou's family members and former aides. The biggest impact was felt in the domestic security apparatus, state oil industry and Sichuan province -- three places Zhou once ruled. Details have also emerged in Chinese media about possible skeletons in Zhou's closet, including the suspicious circumstances surrounding the death of his first wife. Most stories, though, have focused on the vast wealth amassed by Zhou's older son as well as his two brothers and their families. The Zhous reportedly benefited immensely from China's booming energy and real estate sectors thanks to Zhou's deep ties to the two related ministries. Zhou's older son, who is 42, is said to own multiple luxury properties worth millions of dollars. Before turning 30, the younger Zhou had quick success in business after winning a contract to upgrade IT systems for 8,000 gas stations across China. His companies also reportedly reaped huge financial gain from buying and selling oil fields and hydropower stations. State media reports also indicated that one of Zhou's younger brothers, a onetime farmer, used Zhou's influence to launch a "crisis management" business and profited from helping people get out of jail, enter police academy and sell steel pipes to state-owned oil fields. Other published articles have depicted an intricate web of officials, cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around the domestic security czar before the crumbling of his power structure. "I think, unlike Bo Xilai, Zhou Yongkang will cooperate with investigators because his family is involved," analyst Lam said. "His only incentive now is to protect his son -- he will toe the line to protect his son." Read: Is China's corruption crackdown really a political purge?  </corpo>

            <descricao>Myanmar's human rights icon Aung San Suu Kyi has arrived in Beijing on a landmark trip and met President Xi Jinping.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Myanmar's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has met Chinese President Xi Jinping as she begins a trip that will emphasize the Nobel laureate's apparent transition from human rights defender to pragmatic politician. Suu Kyi met Wednesday with Wang Jiarui, a senior official of the Chinese Communist Party, shortly after touching down in the Chinese capital, according to China's state-run media. Wang is vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and head of the International Department of the Communist Party's Central Committee. Suu Kyi also met with Xi, and she is scheduled to meet with Premier Li Keqiang during her trip, according to her party, the National League for Democracy. Observers say China hopes that the June 10-14 visit, a party-to-party meeting between the National League for Democracy and the Chinese Communist Party, will allow the country to boost its waning influence in its southern neighbor, which has increased engagement with the West during dramatic political reforms in recent years. Meanwhile, Suu Kyi's first visit to China offers an opportunity to burnish her credentials as a stateswoman before national elections later this year, said Aung Zaw, editor-in-chief of The Irrawaddy, a news magazine which specializes in covering politics in Myanmar and Southeast Asia. "She's been dubbed a darling of the West, but she's showing she's someone they can work with," he said.  Activists are calling on Suu Kyi, who was held under house arrest for nearly 15 years by Myanmar's former military junta, to speak out on human rights issues during her visit to China, which is cracking down on dissent. In particular, Human Rights Watch's Sophie Richardson said in a statement, Suu Kyi should call for the immediate release of her fellow Nobel Peace Prize winner, the writer Liu Xiaobo, who is serving an 11-year sentence for "inciting subversion of state power" by calling for political reform and human rights. But observers say any such move is unlikely. "I don't think Beijing is inviting her as an icon of democracy," said Zaw. "I think they're seeing her as a politician who is ready to play." The 69-year-old leader of Myanmar's opposition National League for Democracy has been criticized since her release from house arrest in 2010 for her failure to speak up regarding causes in her country, notably the persecution of the Rohingya Muslim minority, which has created a refugee crisis in the region. "The Aung San Suu Kyi we used to know and the one we know today are very different," said Zaw, adding that she had also disappointed some people when a commission she led had approved a controversial Chinese-operated copper mine over the objections of protesters. "She has become a politician," Zaw said. "She's no longer a human rights activist." David Mathieson, a senior researcher on Asia for Human Rights Watch, told CNN that China's leaders are confident that Suu Kyi will not embarrass them. "Beijing is probably... calculating that Suu Kyi's refusal to speak out on many human rights issues in her own country means she is unlikely to speak out about China's denial of democracy and appalling human rights record," Mathieson said. READ MORE: Why is Aung San Suu Kyi silent on the Rohingya issue?  Suu Kyi's visit comes at a turbulent time in the relationship between China and Myanmar. Myanmar, also known as Burma, relied on its northern neighbor as a diplomatic ally and investor during the decades when it was an international pariah state ruled by an authoritarian military junta. But since political reforms in 2011, relations between China and Myanmar's quasi-military government have run "hot and cold" due to a number of issues, said Zaw. In March, five people were killed in China's Yunnan province when a shell from fighting between Myanmar government troops and ethnic Kokang rebels strayed across the border. And China, the largest investor in Myanmar, has been unhappy when major infrastructure projects it has backed, such as the Myitsone dam, have been suspended due to protests. "China's leaders can no longer trust Burma's military-backed civilian government to guarantee its many interests in the country," said Mathieson. By building bridges with Suu Kyi, China was underlining its interest in Myanmar, said Zaw. "Everyone is coming to play the game over there and I think China is telling them they're a stakeholder," he said.  While Suu Kyi cannot run for president -- a clause in Myanmar's military-drafted constitution bars her, as someone who has been married to a foreigner -- her party will likely be more powerful in the new government, said Mathieson. "This is China hedging its bets by expanding their relationship with her," he said. The move could also be read as a snub to Myanmar's quasi-military government in light of recent tensions. "The invitation will no doubt upset the Burmese government," said Zaw. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said at a briefing Tuesday that the visit was intended to "further enhance mutual understanding between the two parties, and move forward the China-Myanmar friendly and cooperative relations." Meanwhile, China's state-run Global Times was upbeat about the visit, saying in an editorial it believed Suu Kyi would "become a good friend of China's."

            <corpo>Seoul, South Korea (CNN)She's 77 and has chronic asthma. But Kim Bok-soon has also survived MERS, the mysterious virus that's spreading in South Korea and putting thousands in quarantine. Ten people have now died from Middle East Respiratory Syndrome in South Korea; all elderly with pre-existing conditions. It can kill up to a third of people infected, but somehow Kim survived. She had an asthmatic episode and was treated at St. Mary's Hospital in Pyeongtaek between May 4 and May 16. South Korea's "Patient Zero," the man who brought MERS from the Middle East, was at the same hospital at the same time, as the virus started to spread. Kim was sent home with a week's worth of medication. When her condition didn't improve, she went back to St Mary's. Again, doctors sent her home but her symptoms got worse. "I felt cold. I was sweating. I coughed all night. I wet my pants because I was coughing so hard," she said. "I thought, 'This is not good.' So I went back to St. Mary's hospital. But they were closed." The hospital had been shut down because dozens of people there had been infected with MERS: patients like Kim, medical staff and visitors. At least 37 cases of MERS have been linked to that initial outbreak. Kim checked into another nearby hospital. By then, South Korean authorities had been shocked into action. The doctors attending to her wore full biohazard suits. "They came in covered from head to toe and took blood samples and other things," she said. The tests showed Kim had MERS and she was transferred to Seoul University Hospital. Still Kim, a devout Christian, said she wasn't scared. She continued to pray and rely on God's help as well as medical intervention. The medical staff continued to treat her, so swathed in protective gear that Kim couldn't see their faces properly. She guessed she had beaten MERS the day they came into her room without the white suits. "They ran into my room, not even wearing doctors' gowns, and told me, 'You will be going back to general ward!' "I was so happy," she said. "All the doctors and nurses were there in the hallway. They all applauded." She was sent home the next day. "I felt like I could fly."  </corpo>

            <descricao>The numbers sound scary as cases and deaths of MERS mount daily in South Korea. </descricao>
            <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)The numbers sound scary as cases and deaths of MERS mount daily in South Korea. People are commuting with face masks in a densely crowded Asian capital, schools are shutting doors and mandatory quarantines are in effect. But what really are the risks and dangers to the general public? As one official said, South Korea is fighting two battles: MERS and public fear.  Not really. "It's not a very contagious disease," said Dr. Stanley Perlman, one of the authors of a comprehensive MERS review published in the journal Lancet this month. "Personally, people shouldn't be worried, but I can understand the fear factor." South Koreans are being told to take basic preventative measures like keeping hands clean, covering coughs and avoiding personal contact. A person with MERS is estimated to infect less than one other person. It's called a basic reproduction number that estimates the average number of people that a sick person will infect. Compared with the reproduction number for Ebola, (in which one infected person is likely to spread the disease to two other people) or measles (one infected person is likely to to spread the infection to 15 other people), the rate of MERS is low indeed.  Here's what the science shows: A 2014 research looked at how many people got ill after living in the same home as MERS patients in Saudi Arabia, the country most affected by MERS, Of 280 people who lived in the same households of the Saudi patients, 4% were infected, according to the research published in the New England Journal of Medicine. If you haven't been sick at a South Korean hospital, and you haven't traveled to Saudi Arabia, you really need not panic. Experts say your risk is low. Read: Are we ready for the next global outbreak?  The MERS virus could mutate -- in the same way viruses are known to undergo changes and genetic recombinations. But right now, there is no evidence of genetic mutation in what's been found in the South Korean cases compared to the Saudi cases. But coronaviruses are prone to mutation, which could increase risk of a pandemic.  That's one of the most important questions right now. The World Health Organization has a fact finding mission this week to examine what's happening with MERS in South Korea. South Korea has a modern and sophisticated health care system. And that could be one of the reasons why the country is reporting so many cases. They're testing people who could've been exposed or are showing any possible symptoms of MERS. MERS symptoms are fairly general including cold-like symptoms, cough, fever and nausea. CNN asked the Ministry of Health how many people in the country have been tested for MERS, but have not gotten a number.  The MERS count includes people with mild symptoms, and at least one of the confirmed cases has been completely asymptomatic. The growing case count doesn't mean everyone with MERS is gravely ill. Several patients have been cleared and hundreds have been released from quarantine.  The first MERS patient in South Korea traveled to four Middle Eastern countries. After he developed symptoms, he visited four health care facilities back home. This means he exposed his fellow patients, their families and health care staff in several facilities before getting diagnosed. "I think it's the combination of poor initial handling of the first patient," said Perlman. "When a MERS patient came to the U.S. or Europe, they were isolated when there was hint of something going on. In this case, the patient wandered around hospitals and family members weren't protected and that's the reason why it's gotten worse than other non Arabian countries."  The bulk of the latest MERS cases have come from two hospitals: St. Mary's, located south of Seoul, and the Samsung Medical Center, based in Seoul's glitzy Gangnam district. Similar to emergency rooms in the United States, hospitals in Korea are often crowded with sick patients waiting to get care. They are exposed to each other in close proximity. Also in South Korea, family members rather than nurses often stay bedside by patients, changing them and taking care of them. This also exposes them to additional risk of infection. Hospital-based MERS outbreaks are by no means new though. Saudi Arabia reported a 2013 outbreak that infected 23 patients in an intensive care unit. In that outbreak, 15 people died.  Like many viral diseases, MERS is much more lethal for people who are already severely ill. Of those who've died in South Korea after contracting MERS, the deceased patients had pre-existing conditions including cancer, COPD and chronic heart disease. "There's a lot of illnesses that make people more prone to infection," Perlman said. "The obvious are asthma, emphysema, lung disease might not be able to handle infection very well." MERS globally has been known to carry about a 30 to 40% death rate. But the death rate in the South Korean outbreak has consistently remained been under 10%. Perlman says he believes the death rate could be lower because South Korean health authorities are finding more cases including mild ones that may not have been picked up before.  Not really. Of nearly 100 cases in South Korea, only one of the MERS cases is a teenager. This doesn't mean that children don't get infected -- but it's worth looking at the facts that the vast majority of the MERS patients are older. Perlman says he doesn't think shutting schools is ideal since the virus is not very contagious, but said he "can understand why people worry."  Well, MERS has already popped up in the United States in 2014 -- long before the South Korean cases. Both cases in the United States involved health workers who worked in Saudi Arabia and traveled to Indiana and Florida. The World Health Organization doesn't recommend any travel or trade restrictions. Hong Kong, which grappled with SARS over 10 years ago, issued a red alert warning travelers to avoid non-essential travel to South Korea.  MERS is in the same family of viruses as SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome -- coronavirus) as well as the common cold. However, unlike SARS, which sickened more than 8,000 people in 2003 and killed 773 worldwide, MERS does not spread easily between humans. SARS eventually waned because health officials quarantined people who were exposed and contained the infection.  Yes, it comes down to the fact that scientists don't know much about MERS. It's a relatively new syndrome and there is no vaccine or cure. And the exact mode of how MERS is transmitted remains unknown.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Four foreign hikers who posed naked on Mount Kinabalu in Malaysia were freed Friday after they were fined and sentenced to time served. The backpackers -- from Britain, Canada and the Netherlands -- were arrested after stripping naked May 30 and posing for photos on the mountaintop, the nation's Bernama news agency reported. The mountain is considered sacred in Malaysia. They had pleaded guilty to "committing an obscene act." CNN has verified the identity of the two Canadians as Lindsey and Danielle Peterson. The Briton is named Eleanor Hawkins. The name of the Dutchman has not yet been confirmed by CNN.  The court in Kota Kinabalu on Friday evening fined the four 5,000 Malaysian ringgits, about $1,332, each and sentenced them to three days in prison. Taking into account the time served already, the court ordered them freed. Local residents had said their behavior caused the Kota Kinabalu earthquake this month, which killed 16 people. The indigenous people of Sabah believe the tourists disrespected local culture and angered the spirit of the mountain, Bernama reported. Among those who appeared in court was a British citizen who was arrested at the airport this week as she was about to leave for the capital of Kuala Lumpur. The other three turned themselves in. They could have faced three months in prison.  It is not the first time tourists have made headlines for stripping off their clothes at major attractions. Cambodia deported two U.S. tourists for allegedly taking nude pictures at Angkor Archaeological Park after a string of nudity-related incidents hit the religious sites this year. At least eight tourists were detained last year in separate incidents for getting naked and posing for photos in Machu Picchu, the 15th-century attraction in Peru.

            <descricao>A new book entitled Fashion China provides an introduction to 41 of the country's most exciting designers.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The obsession of Chinese luxury shoppers with Western brands is old news. Now, a new book entitled Fashion China is turning the spotlight on the top local brands vying for the international spotlight. Written by Irish fashion curator Gemma A. Williams, the book provides an introduction to 41 of the country's most exciting designers, from Fashion Fringe award-winner Haizhen Wang to couturier Laurence Xu. "We're creating a snapshot of what is going on over there," says Williams. "Designers play by their own rules, and it creates such an interesting dynamic." The author, who sports Alexander McQueen and New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art in her resume, was initially inspired by the growing number of Chinese international students she encountered while working at the London College of Fashion's Fashion Space Gallery in 2013.  To find the most interesting designers, Williams brought together a panel of Chinese experts, including Liu Wen -- widely considered the first Chinese supermodel -- and Karchun Leung, editor of Numéro China. "I'm going over with Western eyes and trying to understand the industry in terms of our systems, which has been the base for 100 years at least," she says. "Collaboration with [the panel] really opened my eyes to how unique the industry was." These differences include a unique design history and tradition, as well as a less strict adherence to the fashion calendar model that dominates in the West. (China has two major fashion weeks -- Beijing and Shanghai -- with irregular rosters, and many high profile designers show off-schedule or abroad.) "They helped me realize that the same criteria will never apply to the Chinese market. It's too large and it's too new, so they can set their own benchmarks."  By profiling a range of designers, Fashion China dispels common misconceptions and stereotypes about what Chinese fashion means. Designers like Guo Pei, who creates lavish, architectural couture gowns in Beijing, prove that 'Made in China' needn't mean shoddy quality; and the international buzz behind London-based newcomer Ryan Lo's colorful kitsch shows that Chinese design doesn't have to be traditional. But Williams thinks it could be a while before a Chinese designer becomes a household name abroad. Because of the diversity and breadth of their aesthetics, she doubts there will be a unified rise to prominence similar to that of avant garde Japanese designers like Yohji Yamamoto and Comme des Garçons creator Rei Kawakubo in the 1970's and 80's. "Chinese fashion is so varied and so disparate that it's very hard to pick out one or two aesthetics ... It's not like Japan, where they had a unified aesthetic that became a very strong look," she says. However, Williams hopes the book will encourage Westerners to shop outside their comfort zones, and recognize the value of work being done outside of the fashion capitals. "My main goal is to promote," she says. "It's really exciting that people are talking about these brands and finding out about them, and I hope [Fashion China] opens up the discourse around Chinese fashion." Fashion China is published by Thames &amp; Hudson.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Buying Western luxury goods from China at the right price isn't always easy -- but Mihaibao is looking to change that.</descricao>
            <corpo>Traders highlights the business of global trading by showcasing extraordinary individuals worldwide who are trading goods and services across borders. (CNN)In China, the demand for luxury goods has never been bigger, but connecting Chinese shoppers with designer goods isn't always easy, says Jacqueline Lam, cofounder of Mihaibao, a company that's looking to bridge the gap between the top Western designer brands and hungry consumers in the East. "It's very difficult for people to buy from Western websites in China," explained Lam. "It's not just the language barrier, the shopping experience is entirely different: the foreign servers slow things down, you can't pay in Yuan and that's before you face customs and import duty." And demand for expensive goods in China is growing exponentially, with one report suggesting that China will account for 20% of the global luxury sales in 2015.  You might think it's already been done, with Chinese online retailer Xiu and the host of glitzy designer shops that have opened in China's large cities. But last year, there were reports that those same shops were slashing their exorbitant prices as consumers favored making trips abroad to buy direct and avoid the high taxes at home. In addition, Mihaibao doesn't have the expense of foreign buyers shopping for a set list of products, like Xiu does. Instead, Lam's company has no inventory to speak of, just a group of software and data engineers. "We're a tech company," Lam clarified. "Our engineers manage data on currency so people can pay in Yuan, the latest trends so customers can keep up with the latest fashion and all the placement and orders are done automatically." Chinese consumers can now pick the products they want directly from the website and the rest is done automatically by the systems Lam put in place -- from calculating live prices and import costs to arranging the delivery. On top of that, Mihaibao believes its data knowledge has enabled it to exploit key trends not just for consumer demand but also to help the big-name brands market the right products to Chinese customers. "We have studied the online shopping experience in China -- it's nothing like the West," Lam said. "We've changed it by making it transparent, easy to use and adapting our website to the way China shops." She continued: "Not only can we tailor the Chinese shopper's experience but we can also help brands target the people that have created demand for a particular product -- we know how the Chinese shopper thinks."  Lam, 28, was born in China and later moved to Denmark as a teenager. She continued her university studies in the United Kingdom and went on to work for retail data giant Dunnhumby, before starting Mihaibao in 2014. Whether it can fill the gaps the luxury brands and e-commerce sites have missed remains to be seen but expansion is on the cards with a fresh round of investment and help from the UK government's Trade and Investment department. "We started with luxury handbags but we're going to meet the demand for other luxury goods in beauty, baby care, wine, art and furniture," Lam said. "People in China want Western goods -- they associate it with a better life and sophistication -- and if you have the money you'll buy from the West, not from China." Lam also hopes to help eradicate the "gray market," where Chinese people come into the country with products they've bought abroad -- something the Chinese government is working hard to stop. She said: "This trend of people coming back with gifts from overseas trips has been going on for ages ... we want to take out the hassle so people can buy cost-effectively without having to bother their family members in the West."

            <corpo>Future Cities: Singapore focuses on the exceptionally forward-looking urban approach of the island nation to learn about the challenges of planning for future generations. (CNN)It's a small, dense, island nation where 100% of the population is urbanized. And yet, the city-state of Singapore is the greenest city in Asia, according to the Green City Index, and arguably has few competitors in the rest of the world. As Singapore's population and economy grew, so did its green cover: it was about 36% in the 1980s and it now stands at 47%, according to the Center for Liveable cities. And while the word "green" can take on a variety of connotations, Singapore appears to encompass them all -- lush environments, renewable energy and future sustainability. "We take steps to ensure our self-sufficiency," says Yvonne Soh, General Manager of the Singapore Green Buildings Council. "In Singapore we have a lot of initiatives to promote sustainability." That's crucial, as the city-state lacks any form of natural resource. Half of the nation's water supplies are imported from neighbouring Malaysia, with the rest sourced from desalinization plants, efficient catchment of rainwater and recycling of sewage. Fuel is also imported to meet energy needs, making alternative energy a national priority. But greenery in the literal sense is also prioritized. "If you build a new development, you have to replace the same greenery you replaced," says Yoh. Singapore is only country to incorporate green building requirements into its legislation, according to Soh. "Environmental protection was not assumed to be at odds with economic development," says Khoo Teng Chye, Executive director of the Centre for Liveable Cities. "The government saw that it was an integral part of city planning," he says.  One initiative in place to ensure a more sustainable 'green' status throughout the country is the Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark Scheme -- a rating system introduced in 2005 to evaluate all buildings based on their environmental impact and performance. "This makes sure buildings are green through-and-through," says Yoh. Today, there are more than 1,180 green mark buildings. The mark is awarded at four levels -- Certified, Gold, GoldPLUS, and Platinum. "All buildings within the marina bay district are green-mark platinum," says Yoh. But this is now extending beyond the marina, with developers throughout Singapore now chasing after the highly regarded platinum status -- including UK architecture firm Foster and Partners, whose recent green complex on Beach road in downtown Singapore opened in-part this year with the rest due to open in 2016.  The Beach road project by Foster and Partners spans an entire city block and incorporates the Singaporean tradition of skyscrapers through its two towers containing residential and office space. But the complex is setting new trends through a large undulating canopy that embodies a simple, yet innovative, concept -- shelter. "The need was shelter and protection," says Jonathan Parr, a partner in the firm who led the project. In a hot, tropical climate like Singapore the need to cool and protect people from direct sunlight and shelter them from the rain ranks high on the list of priorities. "The rain is torrential," says Parr. Through a series of arcs, the canopy is designed to scoop wind at its entrance and draw wind through the space as a means of natural ventilation. Combined with solar panels for power, solar tubes for hot water, harvesting of rainwater and certain floor levels lined fully with green plants, the complex is green in every sense of the world. "Singaporeans love nature and green spaces," says Yoh. This is reflected through the recent opening of a 15 mile stretch of hidden parkland containing an unused railway in 2014, known as the Green Corridor -- resembling New York's highline, which was a people-led movement to conserve the land. Renewable energy sources and rainwater harvesting have also become standard on all buildings in Singapore, including the man-made supertrees in the gardens by the bay and the lotus-shaped ArtScience museum nearby.  "People are happiest when they're most connected to nature," says Chris Trott, Head of Sustainability at Foster and Partners, who believes setting schemes and legislation in this way can create awareness in the mind of both developers and the public. "They're all aimed at a reduction in the use of energy and therefore reduction in carbon dioxide deposited into the atmosphere," says Trott. Singapore pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 16% below business as usual levels in 2020, under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. With such demand -- and competition -- for sustainability, when it comes to this target there may be no competition at all.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Police in Malaysia arrested a foreign woman Tuesday who is believed to have been among tourists who stripped at the summit of Mount Kinabalu, a report said. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Police in Malaysia have arrested four foreigners believed to have been part of a group of tourists who stripped naked at the summit of Mount Kinabalu, according to Bernama, Malaysia's official news agency. The arrested tourists were two Canadian brothers, a Dutch woman and a British woman aged between 20 and 33, said Jalauddin Abdul Rahman, police commissioner in the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah. The British woman was arrested by police at Tawau Airport on Tuesday as she was about to leave for the capital Kuala Lumpur, Bernama reported. The other three turned themselves in on Tuesday evening. A local magistrate's court said they would be held for four days while the "obscene act" that took place on the mountain was investigated. The suspects could face up to three months in jail or a fine if convicted. The mountain was shaken by an earthquake Friday in which at least 16 people were killed. The indigenous people of Sabah believe the tourists' behavior on May 30, deemed disrespectful of local culture, angered the spirit of the mountain and was the reason for the earthquake, Bernama reported. The tourists names were not released. Jalaluddin said police were still looking for the other tourists who stripped on the mountain. "According to the picture... you can see 5-10 people who are naked, but for now, we have detained four of them," he said. "We will continue the investigation and look for who else is involved, and if they are still in Sabah, we will catch them."  Among those killed Friday were several students and at least one teacher from a primary school in Singapore who were on a trip to Mount Kinabalu when the magnitude-6.0 quake struck. Many made it out alive -- including 167 climbers helped to safety by mountain guides, Malaysia's fire and rescue department said Sunday. The UNESCO-listed Mount Kinabalu National Park -- including the namesake peak, which rises to 4,095 meters (13,435 feet) above sea level -- is a geographic jewel in Malaysian Borneo. It's so popular that visitors have to book two to three months in advance to secure one of 196 daily allocated hiking permits.  It's not the first time tourists have made headlines for failing to keep their clothes on at tourist attractions. Cambodia deported two U.S. tourists for allegedly taking nude pictures at Angkor Archaeological Park after a string of nudity-related incidents hit the religious sites early this year. At least eight tourists were detained in three separate incidents for getting naked and posing for photos in Machu Picchu, the 15th-century Inca citadel in Peru last year. Journalist Chan Kok Leong in Kuala Lumpur and CNN's Maggie Wong in Hong Kong contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Art Basel Hong Kong's eerily realistic nude sculpture  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>What kind of model could pose nude in a gallery 24-hours-a-day? Answer: The fake kind. Welcome to Art Basel, one of Hong Kong's biggest art fairs.</descricao>
            <corpo>Hong Kong (CNN)A crowd of people jostle for a closer look at the naked woman crouching on her knees. Phones held aloft, the group shamelessly take pictures of her bare back and bottom -- safe in the knowledge she won't be waking up anytime soon. The remarkably life-like nude sculpture, created by Australian artist Sam Jinks, was by far the most photographed work at this year's Art Basel in Hong Kong, a three-day art fair that has attracted tens of thousands of visitors since it first launched nearly three years ago. A powerhouse brand in the art fair industry, Art Basel bought-out the homegrown Hong Kong International Art Fair in 2011, and quickly cemented the city's position in the multi-billion dollar global art market. This year's fair brought together 233 galleries from 37 countries and territories. Half of the galleries are from the Asian region, including Hong Kong, mainland China, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, and Southeast Asia. "It's a one-stop shop," is how Art Basel in Hong Kong director, Asia Adeline Ooi, describes the blockbuster show. "We have the best of Asia and the best of the rest of the world in the room." Just across from Jink's hyper-real nude model is Japanese art superstar Takashi Murakami's Kaikai KiKi booth, filled with statement works from the anime-inspired Superflat movement. Along with the hugely popular nude model, Jinks also created this sculpture from silicone, resin and human hair. Nearby is the booth for Hong Kong-based French dealer, Edouard Malingue, who shows established European names such as Laurent Grasso, alongside local up-and-comers -- most notably João Vasco Paiva, who displayed a nearly six-meter-tall sculpture resembling Styrofoam boxes typically found on the streets of Hong Kong. The emphasis on regional representation is what makes the fair stand out from its two counterparts, Art Basel in Basel, and Art Basel in Miami, and from the 180 other major international art fairs that take place throughout the year. While people from all walks of life come to ogle the art, and flocks of excitable school children are herded through, nattily dressed gallerists are quietly sealing million-dollar deals. A Chris Ofili painting titled "Dead Monkey - Sex, Money and Drugs," was sold for $2 million at David Zwirner's booth within the first hour of the fair's VIP preview on March 13. Art Basel in Hong Kong moved from its original May dates to March 15-17 this year, coinciding with the Hong Kong Arts Festival and the International Film Festival. The Hong Kong Tourism Board has dubbed March the "Hong Kong Arts Month." Art fervor has spilled beyond the art sector and even the city's shopping malls are filled with grand installations to coincide with the fair. It is also the first year of satellite art fair, Art Central, created by the same founders of the original Hong Kong International Art Fair and meant to complement Art Basel in Hong Kong. Chinese artist, Xu Longshen's painting, "Beholding the Mountain with Awe No.1," was presented by Hanart TZ Gallery. Collectors have been flooding into the city for the past week, including American actress Susan Sarandon, Swiss businessman Ulli Sigg, Britain's Tate galleries director Nicholas Serota, and Alibaba founder Jack Ma. "People are taking Hong Kong very seriously now. Some people say we've finally arrived," says Ooi. As Hong Kong matures as an art market hub and the hype over art fairs swell, more questions will be raised as to the future for local artists and the healthy growth of regional art producers. Sales made at global art fairs accounted for 40% of all dealer sales in 2014, or an estimated $10 billion, the second largest sales channel after in-gallery transactions, according to the European Fine Art Foundation. Briton Peter Liversidge's artwork, "Always," featured 447 light bulbs. "In a week like this past week, the art world has its eye on Hong Kong and it's great, but the real game change will be M+," says Hong Kong-based art consultant Alex Errera referring to the museum of modern and contemporary art and visual culture that is currently being constructed at the West Kowloon Cultural District. "It's easy to fall into the trap of having so many things happening in one week — everybody already knows that Hong Kong is a great place for business, it's more important that the attraction to the region can be sustained."

            <corpo>Future Cities: Singapore focuses on the exceptionally forward-looking urban approach of the island nation to learn about the challenges of planning for future generations. (CNN)Singapore is small, hot and heavily populated -- the 5.5 million residents of the tropical city-state live in less than 750 square kilometres of land. And population is expected to reach 6.9 million by 2030. Despite these challenges, Singapore continues to be amongst the most liveable and economically successful cities in the word, with a GDP equaling that of leading European countries. With more than 50% of the world's population living in cities already (a figure projected to reach 70% by 2050), Singapore -- where everyone is a city dweller -- is setting trends for rapidly urbanizing countries worldwide. But how have they done it?  Concept plans have been in place since 1971, with long-term visions and predictions for the design of Singapore's infrastructure. Such long-term planning was crucial as the population was growing much faster than originally anticipated. "The top priorities for Singapore as a newly independent state were to provide housing for its people and to create jobs," says Khoo Teng Chye, Executive Director of the Centre for Liveable Cities, Singapore. With limited land and no natural resources, there was always a focus on greenery, the environment and intensive development of utilities and infrastructure including power plants, deep-underground sewerage and refuse incineration. "Planning for clean air, clean water and green cover was integral to Singapore's city planning," says Khoo. Decentralization of commercial hubs was also key in the country's urban design to reduce congestion and commuting time -- improving liveability. "High density does not necessarily mean low liveability," says Khoo.  With high-density living comes high-density waste. But Singapore has been organized with its refuse management systems, not only by collecting it efficiently but even employing it to make more land. "They don't have the space to store waste," says Dirk Hebel, from the Future Cities Laboratory at the Singapore-ETH Centre for Global Environmental Sustainability. Waste is managed instead through regular incineration and the resulting ashes are combined with marine sand to extend Singapore's land mass. "They use ashes for landfill to extend the territory," says Hebel. In addition, the country has set a precedent for water resources through its desalination plants and NEWater plants, where sewage is filtered to recycle it into drinking water. But Hebel's group are now working on new avenues for using waste -- this time to construct buildings instead of land. "In Singapore you have almost 80% high-value resource waste," says Hebel. This category of waste includes plastics and glass, which could be re-purposed for building materials. Hebel's team recently exhibited the possibilities of waste recycling during the 2015 New York City Ideas Festival. They built an arched canopy pavilion comprised of waterproof panels made from discarded beverage containers. The canopy was anchored to a base composed of stacked, wooden pallets. Hebel sees future possibilities in Singapore: "There are things surrounding us that can be used in a secondary life as a building structure," he says.  Due to its close proximity to the equator, Singapore's climate is hot and humid, with temperatures averaging above 30 degrees Celsius and little variation throughout the year. The built-up nature of the city increases temperatures further through the 'heat island' effect -- caused by buildings blocking air flow, transport emissions and long-wave radiation heating up the island nation. As a result, a lot of the city's energy expenditure goes towards cooling people down. "Up to 60% of Singapore's electricity is for buildings," says Arno Schlüter, Professor of Architecture and building systems, also with the Future Cities Laboratory. Most buildings use electricity to cool-down and dehumidify public and work spaces. "Singapore is a noisy city due to all the [cooling] units on the wall," says Schlüter. To overcome this overconsumption of energy, Schlüter's team are now piloting a project with the United World College of South East Asia in which they are dehumidifying the air external to a building and flowing the resulting cool air over the façade of a building. According to FCL, "the technology consists of passive chilled beams, distributed ventilation units combined with an underfloor air distribution network and new control systems," and removed the need for air conditioning systems. "It means we can save a lot of space -- up to 1/3 of a building," says Schlüter. Designs for new buildings in Singapore now also regularly incorporate design for natural ventilation by capturing and promoting wind flow through a public space.  When population increases and demand for land spikes accordingly, the tendency is to build upwards -- as is the case for most cities worldwide. But with unique -- and more pressing -- land restrictions compared to the rest of the world, Singapore has now begun to build downwards and is taking workplaces underground. And they're going deep underground -- first with ammunition facilities, then the Jurong rock caverns storing oil in caverns deep below the ground and soon other industries, such as science laboratories. "[It's a] new way of using underground space on a larger scale," says Jian Zhao, Professor of Geomechanics at Monash University, Australia. Zhao was previously at Nanyang technical university in Singapore where he developed the first research proposals exploring the options to go underground. The design involves digging caverns into rocks more than 100 meters below the ground. "Underground, everything is much more stable," says Zhao referring to factors such as vibrations, temperature and humidity which are important for facilities such as power plants, water reservoirs and industrial settings in general. "The idea is to make the city more liveable by putting everything undesirable underground," he says.  The technological development of Singapore cannot be forgotten as this aspect of city living has long been incorporated into the design of the city-state. The Singapore mass rapid transit (MRT) is considered among the best public transport systems in the world -- needed due to restrictions on vehicle ownership -- and intelligent buildings have been in use for more than a decade aiding movement and entertainment through public and work spaces. But increasing density is putting more pressure on the country's infrastructure. "Singapore needs to adapt and innovate," says Khoo, in order to meet needs for residence, recreation and lifestyle. Innovation has been at the root of the country's development -- both for liveability and sustainability. "Technology is a key feature of green buildings," says Yvonne Soh, General Manager of the Singapore Green Buildings Council. "[It can] respond to the environment quickly and to people," she says. Responding to movements and uses of space in real-time can cut energy requirements dramatically. This emphasis on technology has helped Singapore become one of the Greenest cities in the world.  Singapore is now exporting its expertise in urban planning to other cities in Asia where rapid urbanization is taking place -- including the Tianjin Eco city, China and the new capital city in Andhra Pradesh, India -- paving the way for cities around the world. "Through greater collaboration among cities, mass urbanization -- the result of a rapidly growing global urban population -- will ultimately benefit the human race," says Khoo.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>South Korea mulls reopening schools in MERS outbreak - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Exactly a month ago, a South Korean man walked into a hospital complaining of a cough and fever. </descricao>
            <corpo>Seoul, South Korea (CNN)The rate of contagion of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome has slowed in South Korea, a health official said Saturday, and may be on its way down. But the outbreak is not completely over. The outbreak has been "large and complex" and "more cases should be anticipated," an official told reporters. Exactly a month ago, a South Korean man walked into a hospital complaining of a cough and fever. The 68-year-old patient, who had just returned from four Middle Eastern countries, went from facility-to-facility before getting properly diagnosed. He would become "patient zero" of South Korea's outbreak of MERS, which has so far reported 138 cases. The outbreak has sparked international concern, shuttered more than 3,000 schools and stalled the country's economy. Fourteen people in South Korea have died after contracting MERS; however, all deaths have been among older adults with underlying medical conditions. Amid weeks of gloomy news, there seems to be gradual signs of easing as officials are mulling the reopening of schools and more people have been released from quarantine after testing negative. Health officials have said this week is crucial in the battle to contain MERS as many of those in quarantine are near the end of their mandatory isolation period.  The outbreak in South Korea has had ripples elsewhere around the world. On Thursday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an advisory, telling American health care providers to watch for MERS symptoms from people coming from South Korea or Middle East countries. Hong Kong and Macau raised travel alerts asking their residents to avoid unnecessary travel to South Korea. Passengers from South Korea to Hong Kong's airport are getting temperature checks. Hong Kong is particularly sensitive to the prospect of an outbreak as it endured hundreds of deaths from the SARS outbreak of 2002-3. But it has not been the only one. China, which also grappled with SARS, has also taken precautions. The Chinese aviation regulator ordered all airlines traveling to Korea to disinfect the plane more frequently, reported Xinhua. Also the organizers of the Shanghai Film Festival, which starts Saturday, emailed Korean participants to say they should cancel their trips due to MERS. The email "was only to provide suggestion," said Yang Xinwei, the festival's spokeswoman. The outbreak has also taken a toll on tourism to South Korea and affected industries such as transportation and restaurants in the country. 5 things to know about MERS  While South Korea has grappled with the outbreak for three weeks, there is some hope of containment. By Friday, 1,249 people had been released from quarantine after they tested negative for MERS. The number of people kept in quarantine has reduced to 3,680, a drop of 125 from the previous day. And schools may be re-opening next week as the Ministry of Health also said there is a "high possibility" of resuming classes. More than 2,700 schools were shut due to MERS on Friday. In a press conference, the Seoul School superintendent announced that all schools should make their own decisions whether to remain closed or not. Earlier this week, the WHO had recommended reopening them since there is no evidence of MERS circulating in schools and only one of over 100 cases has affected a teenager. An expert team assembled by the World Health Organization is scheduled to hold a news conference Saturday, releasing its assessment of the outbreak and the response in South Korea. CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Kevin Wang contributed to this report from Atlanta. Sol Han contributed to this report from Hong Kong. </corpo>

            <corpo>Beijing (CNN)Rarer than a panda, few people knew about the Ili pika until earlier this year when pictures of China's "magic bunny" went viral after being featured in a series of news reports. But now the tiny and endangered mammal is finding out the price of fame. Conservationist Li Weidong, who discovered the species in 1983, lamented the lack of funding for his conservation efforts when first interviewed by CNN in March. READ: Meet China's 'magic rabbit' He's since been able to raise almost $28,000 on a Chinese crowd-funding website, enough to fund his research and conservation efforts for the next year. But Li told CNN this week that the tiny mammal now faces other threats. People have tried to catch the pika, wanting one as a pet. Companies have offered Li funding to catch the pika and then artificially breed them, Li said. "Ili pikas, as alpine animals, can't adapt to the environment at low elevations without special facilities," he said. "Would they survive? Their population is already small enough. Human capture will accelerate the extinction." Fearing that cameras might disturb pikas, Li said he has also turned away a dozen more photographers who hoped accompany him on his field research in the Tianshan mountains.  Native to the Xinjiang region of northwestern China, there are fewer than 1,000 of these creatures living in the Tianshan mountain range in the region, Li said. Li discovered the pika, formally known as Ochotona iliensis, and named it after his hometown, Ili. A year ago, Li spotted and photographed the elusive creature for the first time since the early 1990s. He estimates its numbers have declined by almost 70% since its discovery. In 2008, the animal was listed as endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature but there's no official organization or team dedicated studying or protecting it, according to Li. For years, Li has called for Ili Pika to be listed on China's List of Wildlife under Special State Protection -- part of the country's 1988 Wildlife Protection Law. The appeal seems more urgent now as more people have laid eyes on the it, Li said. Li said he is in negotiation with authorities in Jinghe County, where many Ili Pikas were discovered, for the establishment of a nature reserve to keep people away from the rare animals.  In late May, Li led a team of five volunteers to collect video footage from infrared cameras set up last August. Some 30 infrared cameras captured about 16 video clips of the Pika from the two areas over the past 10 months. Li said the video clips showed that pikas communicate with each other through their own urine traces and bodily waste. "They can tell by sniffing whether another pika is nearby. If it is a member of the opposite sex, they find a mate. If it is within its own gender, they claim territory." However, Li didn't find any pikas in the two sites where he spotted and photographed the elusive creature in July last year. He said this doesn't mean there are fewer pikas now as footage from one more area is yet to be collected and the cameras only covered half of the census areas. Yet it still worries him, he said. "We don't know whether it's because the animals didn't come out during the winter, or they were eaten by natural enemies or they died." To collect more accurate and complete information, Li said he plans to buy more infrared cameras with the recently raised money and set them up in all six areas.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Lost comet lander Philae sends 'hello' from space - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Philae is alive! The lost comet lander from the Rosetta spacecraft signals ESA's operations center in Germany.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's alive! Many moons ago, a small space probe named Philae skipped across the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko when the lander's harpoon-like anchoring mechanism failed. It came to rest in a shady spot and, without enough sunlight to keep it powered, it fell asleep after about 60 hours of operation. Mission scientists had been trying to pinpoint its location since November -- until late Saturday. At 10:28 p.m., the European Space Agency's operations center in Darmstadt, Germany, just south of Frankfurt, received a signal from Philae, which transmitted more than 300 data packets. Those have been analyzed at the Lander Control Center at the German Aerospace Center, which dubbed Philae's emergence from its seven-month slumber a "'hello' from space." "Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35ºC and has 24 watts available," Philae project manager Stephan Ulamec said in a statement. "The lander is ready for operations." To hear Twitter tell it, Philae's comet-chasing mothership, Rosetta, was delighted to hear from the little lander but reluctant to let it delve back into work too hastily after its long sleep. Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter "Hello @ESA_Rosetta! I'm awake! How long have I been asleep? #Lifeonacomet," came the tweet from Philae's handle. "Hello @Philae2014! You've had a long sleep, about 7 months!" Rosetta responded. "Wow @ESA_Rosetta! That's a long time... time for me to get back to work! #Lifeonacomet" "@Philae2014 Need to check you're fit, healthy and warm enough first @philae2014! Take it easy for now :)" "Oh, OK @ESA_Rosetta! I'm still a bit tired anyway... talk to you later! Back to #lifeonacomet!" Months after Philae nodded off, lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needed almost 6 watts of power to reboot itself, 9 watts to accept communications and 19 watts to allow two-way communication with the orbiter -- not a great deal of power when you consider energy-saving lightbulbs use 20 watts or fewer. There was speculation in March that Philae could be awake but lacking the necessary power to communicate with Rosetta, which was in orbit around Comet 67P looking for the washing machine-sized lander. Scientists sent "blind commands" in hopes that the lander could process the instructions even if it couldn't respond, O'Rourke told CNN in March. But there was not immense confidence that Philae could be revived. Asked his thoughts Sunday, O'Rourke told CNN he was "thrilled" contact was re-established, which "allows us to do more science." "We are all delighted -- delighted that Philae survived the long winter. It's a great opportunity," he said. When the lander snapped its hibernation spell Saturday, it "spoke" with the scientists on the ground for 85 seconds, ESA said. "We have also received historical data -- so far, however, the lander had not been able to contact us earlier," Ulamec said, explaining that Philae must have been awake before Saturday night. Scientists eagerly anticipate Philae's next contact, as the lander's memory still contains more than 8,000 data packets that will tell them what has happened in recent days on Comet 67P. Since March 12, Rosetta has been listening for the lander to determine if it had survived the cold, dark recesses of the comet. Scientists promised that if enough sunlight could fall on Philae's solar panels, it could be revived. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. The mishap, said scientists, could prove to be a happy accident. Had Philae touched down in its original landing spot, O'Rourke explained, the temperatures as the comet neared the sun could have burned out the lander's electronics, killing it altogether. But because it found shade -- beneath a cliff face, scientists deduced from images sent by the lander -- it was able to survive. Now, scientists are excited at the prospect of Philae witnessing a remarkable show as 67P makes its closest approach to the sun in August. "I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point," O'Rourke has said. ESA has led the consortium, which includes NASA, to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun. The mission is already changing perceptions of comets. Instead of thinking of a comet as a dirty snowball, O'Rourke has said, he now thinks of a comet as an "icy dirtball." He also described discoveries of dust and large "boulders" circling the comet after they were blown off by the sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football field that has been lifted and deposited next to the hole. "The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery," he said. CNN Interactive: Rosetta and its mission Opinion: How comet mission helps search for alien life  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)The international charity Save the Children says that its office in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, has been closed by national authorities without notice. But Pakistani authorities on Friday issued a statement saying that several nongovernmental organizations were working against the country's national interests and would not be allowed to continue their work. Save the Children said it has been working in Pakistan for more than 35 years and had a staff of 1,200 people in the country, none of them expatriates. "On June 11, Save the Children confirmed that its office in Islamabad, Pakistan, had been closed and sealed off today by the Pakistani authorities," the international organization said in a Thursday statement. "Save the Children was not served any notice to this effect. We strongly object to this action and are raising our serious concerns at the highest levels."  The government statement Friday, quoting Interior Minister Chaudhary Nisar Ali Khan, said the organizations in question "are operating with support from the United States, Israel and India." The minister said he planned to raise his concerns in parliament. The statement from the ministry said the government does not plan to ban all NGOs but is working on a plan to regulate and facilitate "legal" ones. Save the Children said that last year that its health, education, food security and other programs in the country reached more than 4 million children and their families. The organization said that all its work was "designed and delivered in close collaboration with the government ministries across the country, and aims to strengthen public service delivery systems in health, nutrition, education and child welfare."

            <corpo>(CNN)The highest-ranking Chinese Communist Party official ever to face corruption charges has been sentenced to life in prison, according to a statement Thursday from China's Supreme People's Court. Zhou Yongkang, the country's former security chief, received the sentence after being found guilty of taking bribes, China's top court said, citing the Tianjin No. 1 Intermediate People's Court in northeastern China. Zhou, 72, also received seven years for abusing power and four years for deliberately revealing state secrets. Footage from the court in Tianjin, not far from the Chinese capital, Beijing, showed Zhou looking healthy but now with white hair. He said, "I have acknowledged the fact of my committed crimes, and the loss that was caused to the party's mission. Hereby I am pleading guilty and I am regretful of it." As a member of the ruling Communist Party's Politburo Standing Committee -- China's top decision-making body -- Zhou was one of nine men who effectively ruled the country of more than 1.3 billion people. He retired in 2012. At the height of his power, Zhou controlled police forces, spy agencies, court systems and prosecution offices across China -- and wasn't shy in deploying his vast assets to crush dissent and unrest in the name of "preserving social stability." But prosecutors said Zhou took advantage of his posts to seek benefits for others and illegally accepted large amounts of money during his long political career. State media have painted an intricate web of officials, cronies and tycoons -- some with alleged mafia connections -- orbiting around Zhou before the crumbling of his power structure last summer. He was expelled from the Communist Party and arrested in December before being formally charged in April. Zhou and his family members were said to have accumulated enormous wealth in a blatant exchange between money and power. He was also found to have affairs with multiple women and allegedly traded power for sex, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported last year. Analysts have viewed his shocking downfall as a watershed moment in the secretive world of Chinese politics, now ruled by President Xi Jinping. Xi has been spearheading a massive anti-corruption campaign, targeting both "tigers" and "flies" -- high-ranking, and low-level, officials. Who is Zhou Yongkang?

            <corpo>Future Cities: Singapore focuses on the exceptionally forward-looking urban approach of the island nation, to learn about the challenges of planning for future generations. (CNN)Could sewage be recycled to provide water that's cleaner than what comes out of your tap? The place to find out is the small yet highly urbanized city-state of Singapore. The South-east Asian island country has a population of 5 million residing on less than 750 square kilometers of land. Whilst known for its strong economy, Singapore is lacking one essential asset -- water. Water security has long been a national priority in Singapore as half of its current water supplies are imported from neighboring Malaysia. "We are preparing for the day that should the water agreement expire, we should be ready to fulfill our own needs," says Chew Men Leong, Chief Executive of the Public Utilities Board. The agreement with Malaysia is due to expire in 2061, so the country has time to be ready. Singapore's strategy for a hydrated nation is four-fold: as well as importation, it includes desalinization plants, efficient catchment of rainwater and recycling of sewage. Rainwater is collected through a network of drains, canals, rivers, storm water, collection ponds and reservoirs with the aim to catch water across two-thirds of the country. But the real hope lies in the membrane technology to treat wastewater known as 'NEWater', created by the country's public utilities board. Through a four-step series of barriers and membranes, wastewater is made free of solids, microorganisms, and contaminants resulting in potable water supplies for use by humans and industry. After one decade, the technology meets 30 percent of Singapore's water needs, with plans to triple volumes by 2060. "The level of quality we receive from the Public Utility Board meets and exceeds the expectation," explains Jagadish CV, CEO of Systems on Silicon Manufacturing, where the water is used in their processing of silicon wafers. "We are using the water three times before we let it into the drain," he says. The demand by industry is being further met by a new collaboration with Japanese firm Meiden that will supply factories with recycled industrial water. One and a half Olympic-sized swimming pools of water are currently filtered and treated every day. The goal is to more cost-effectively treat industrial waste streams in the long run. Professor Asit Biswas from the Lee Kuan School of Public Policy feels other countries should follow the example set by Singapore and even the current standards can be improved to eventually re-use every last drop of water. "There are two major future challenges," he says. "First is how to make the water system less energy intensive and the second one is consumer behavior with respect to water." If these challenges can be overcome, this small country will continue to flourish, long into the future.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Seven new cases of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, or MERS, have been confirmed in South Korea, the country's Ministry of Health said Sunday. Officials in Busan, South Korea's second largest city, reported that a person suffering from MERS died Sunday. If confirmed by the Ministry of Health, that would bring to 15 the number of deaths attributed to the virus. At least 10 people have recovered after being infected and 120 are under treatment, the ministry said. South Korean health officials this weekend said the outbreak there was slowing, but additional cases were expected. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia has recorded five cases of MERS in the past week, the official state-run Saudi press agency said Sunday, citing a weekly Ministry of Health statement. According to the World Health Organization, the strain of coronavirus that causes MERS was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. In Seoul, Samsung Medical Center -- one of the city's hospitals that has counted many of the nation's MERS cases among its patients and visitors -- announced Sunday that it will suspend all surgical procedures except for emergency surgery "to fully focus on responding to MERS." More than 50 confirmed MERS cases have been traced back to the medical center, according to the center's website. "We sincerely apologize with our heads bent to the people for causing great concern as Samsung Medical Center became the center (of) the spread of MERS," hospital President Song Jae-hoon said. Exactly a month ago, a South Korean man walked into a hospital complaining of a cough and fever. The 68-year-old patient, who had just returned from four Middle Eastern countries, went from facility to facility before getting properly diagnosed. He would become "patient zero" of the country's outbreak. The outbreak has sparked international concern, shuttered nearly 3,000 schools in South Korea and stalled the country's economy. So far, 2,854 people are under quarantine, according to the Ministry of Health and Welfare. Many schools were expected to reopen Monday, but at least 440 were expected to remain closed. South Korean health officials said last week that would be crucial in the battle to contain MERS, as many of those in quarantine were nearing the end of their mandatory isolation period. CNN's Khushbu Shah contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <corpo>Future Cities: Singapore focuses on the exceptionally forward-looking urban approach of the island nation, to learn about the challenges of planning for future generations. (CNN)An imposing canopy of artificial trees up to 50 meters is high towering over a vast urban oasis. The colossal solar-powered supertrees are found in the Bay South garden: it is part of a 250-acre landscaping project -- Gardens by the Bay -- that is an initiative from Singapore's National Parks Board that sees the cultivation of flora and fauna from foreign lands. The man-made mechanical forest consists of 18 supertrees that act as vertical gardens, generating solar power, acting as air venting ducts for nearby conservatories, and collecting rainwater. To generate electricity, 11 of the supertrees are fitted with solar photovoltaic systems that convert sunlight into energy, which provides lighting and aids water technology within the conservatories below. Read more: 'Vertical farm' blossoms at meatpacking plant Varying in height between 25 and 50 meters, each supertree features tropical flowers and various ferns climbing across its steel framework. The large canopies also operate as temperature moderators, absorbing and dispersing heat, as well as providing shelter from the hot temperatures of Singapore's climate to visitors walking beneath. The project is part of a redevelopment scheme to create a new downtown district in the Marina Bay area, on Singapore's south side. Project organizers hope Gardens by the Bay will become an eco-tourist destination showcasing sustainable practices and plants from across the globe. Lee Kuan Yew, the first prime minister of the Republic of Singapore, said the project would "showcase what we can do to bring the world of plants to all Singaporeans," adding that the gardens would become "the pride of Singapore." Bridges dubbed "skywalks" have been erected connecting several of the higher 50-meter supertrees (the same height as the Arc de Triomphe in Paris), letting visitors stroll between them and view the gardens from dizzying heights. The horticultural heaven also boasts two green conservatories in close proximity -- the Cloud Forest and Flower Dome -- climate-controlled biomes inspired by the shape of an orchid flower, which project organizers hope will become the park's main attractions. The biomes are the equivalent size of four football fields and will become the new home for 220,000 plants from almost every continent. These are some of the only areas where an admission fee is charged -- approximately US$22 (S$28) for holiday-makers or US$16 (S$20) for Singapore residents. One of the sustainable features of the Flower Dome is that horticultural waste feeds a massive steam turbine and generates the electricity on-site to help maintain the cool temperatures of the biome. However, the supertrees and biomes only make up 5% of the multimillion-dollar landscaping development won after an international design competition by UK landscape architects Grant Associates. The remainder of the Bay South garden will pay homage to the ethnic makeup of the country. In the Heritage Gardens, visitors can explore the Chinese, Malay, Indian and Colonial-themed areas and learn about the links between plants and Singapore's history. Surrounding these cultural green spaces in the rest of the 103-acre Bay South park are sprawling areas complete with lakes and bridges. The horticultural oasis stands in contrast to the country's extremely dense urban environment, forming part of the government's overall strategy to transform Singapore into a "city in a garden."  </corpo>

            <descricao>Myanmar's human rights icon Aung San Suu Kyi has arrived in Beijing on a landmark trip and met President Xi Jinping.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Myanmar's opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi has met Chinese President Xi Jinping as she begins a trip that will emphasize the Nobel laureate's apparent transition from human rights defender to pragmatic politician. Suu Kyi met Wednesday with Wang Jiarui, a senior official of the Chinese Communist Party, shortly after touching down in the Chinese capital, according to China's state-run media. Wang is vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and head of the International Department of the Communist Party's Central Committee. Suu Kyi also met with Xi, and she is scheduled to meet with Premier Li Keqiang during her trip, according to her party, the National League for Democracy. Observers say China hopes that the June 10-14 visit, a party-to-party meeting between the National League for Democracy and the Chinese Communist Party, will allow the country to boost its waning influence in its southern neighbor, which has increased engagement with the West during dramatic political reforms in recent years. Meanwhile, Suu Kyi's first visit to China offers an opportunity to burnish her credentials as a stateswoman before national elections later this year, said Aung Zaw, editor-in-chief of The Irrawaddy, a news magazine which specializes in covering politics in Myanmar and Southeast Asia. "She's been dubbed a darling of the West, but she's showing she's someone they can work with," he said.  Activists are calling on Suu Kyi, who was held under house arrest for nearly 15 years by Myanmar's former military junta, to speak out on human rights issues during her visit to China, which is cracking down on dissent. In particular, Human Rights Watch's Sophie Richardson said in a statement, Suu Kyi should call for the immediate release of her fellow Nobel Peace Prize winner, the writer Liu Xiaobo, who is serving an 11-year sentence for "inciting subversion of state power" by calling for political reform and human rights. But observers say any such move is unlikely. "I don't think Beijing is inviting her as an icon of democracy," said Zaw. "I think they're seeing her as a politician who is ready to play." The 69-year-old leader of Myanmar's opposition National League for Democracy has been criticized since her release from house arrest in 2010 for her failure to speak up regarding causes in her country, notably the persecution of the Rohingya Muslim minority, which has created a refugee crisis in the region. "The Aung San Suu Kyi we used to know and the one we know today are very different," said Zaw, adding that she had also disappointed some people when a commission she led had approved a controversial Chinese-operated copper mine over the objections of protesters. "She has become a politician," Zaw said. "She's no longer a human rights activist." David Mathieson, a senior researcher on Asia for Human Rights Watch, told CNN that China's leaders are confident that Suu Kyi will not embarrass them. "Beijing is probably... calculating that Suu Kyi's refusal to speak out on many human rights issues in her own country means she is unlikely to speak out about China's denial of democracy and appalling human rights record," Mathieson said. READ MORE: Why is Aung San Suu Kyi silent on the Rohingya issue?  Suu Kyi's visit comes at a turbulent time in the relationship between China and Myanmar. Myanmar, also known as Burma, relied on its northern neighbor as a diplomatic ally and investor during the decades when it was an international pariah state ruled by an authoritarian military junta. But since political reforms in 2011, relations between China and Myanmar's quasi-military government have run "hot and cold" due to a number of issues, said Zaw. In March, five people were killed in China's Yunnan province when a shell from fighting between Myanmar government troops and ethnic Kokang rebels strayed across the border. And China, the largest investor in Myanmar, has been unhappy when major infrastructure projects it has backed, such as the Myitsone dam, have been suspended due to protests. "China's leaders can no longer trust Burma's military-backed civilian government to guarantee its many interests in the country," said Mathieson. By building bridges with Suu Kyi, China was underlining its interest in Myanmar, said Zaw. "Everyone is coming to play the game over there and I think China is telling them they're a stakeholder," he said.  While Suu Kyi cannot run for president -- a clause in Myanmar's military-drafted constitution bars her, as someone who has been married to a foreigner -- her party will likely be more powerful in the new government, said Mathieson. "This is China hedging its bets by expanding their relationship with her," he said. The move could also be read as a snub to Myanmar's quasi-military government in light of recent tensions. "The invitation will no doubt upset the Burmese government," said Zaw. A spokesperson for China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said at a briefing Tuesday that the visit was intended to "further enhance mutual understanding between the two parties, and move forward the China-Myanmar friendly and cooperative relations." Meanwhile, China's state-run Global Times was upbeat about the visit, saying in an editorial it believed Suu Kyi would "become a good friend of China's."

            <corpo>(CNN)North Korea test-fired three short-range anti-ship missiles off its east coast on Sunday, a South Korean defense official told CNN. "North Korea on June 14 fired three KN-01 missiles near North Korea's eastern city towards sea off east of the peninsula," the South Korean Defense Ministry official said. The missiles were reportedly fired between 4:21 p.m. and 4:47 p.m. (3:21 a.m. to 3:47 a.m. ET), according to South Korea. "The missile test follows the one from February and May," the official said. "Our military is closely monitoring North Korea's movement and is maintaining all military readiness posture for any provocation." According to globalsecurity.org, the KN-01 sufface-to-surface missile has a range of 120 kilometers, about 75 miles. North Korea first test-fired such missiles years ago, at least according to reports from the South Korean government. The Global Security website quotes the South Korean Ministry of Defense as saying that North Korea conducted "10 test launches of its KN-01 anti-ship cruise missile between February 2003 and June 2007."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho> A secret Navy flight over China's military buildup - CNNPolitics.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>It's no accident that the first P8s were deployed to Asia. The P8 is one expression of the Obama administration's pivot to Asia, and here it's watching China.</descricao>
            <corpo>Above the South China Sea (CNN)Take-off is swift on the U.S. Navy's P8-A Poseidon -- there's no slow roll down the runway on military flights -- and within minutes, the turquoise blue of the South China Sea comes into view from the window of America's most advanced surveillance and sub-hunting aircraft. The P8 crew, composed of more than a dozen naval aviators, invited me into the cockpit to watch and to listen. CNN last week first reported on this secret surveillance mission, which eight times received warnings from the Chinese navy to leave the contested area. This is a behind-the-scenes look at the journey. Approaching the P8-A Poseidon on the tarmac, it's easy to mistake the sophisticated aircraft for one of the many other Boeing 737 planes around it. The P8 is based on a 737 frame, but the similarities end there. Exclusive: China warns U.S. surveillance plane Peeking out of the fuselage are numerous antennas, domes and camera wells, plus a bomb bay for sub-hunting torpedoes and spaces under the wings for Harpoon air-to-surface missiles. Inside, the jet is home to an array of advanced intelligence-gathering equipment. I have the feeling of entering a CIA listening station in the sky. It's no accident that the first P8s -- only 18 months old -- were deployed to Asia. The P8 is one expression of the Obama administration's pivot to Asia, and its principle mission here is keeping a watchful eye on China. Once we're aboard, we sit in on the flight crew's "delta briefing," the final briefing before takeoff. The aircraft's commander, Lt. Cmdr. Matt Simpson, lays out the mission plan. The P8 will leave from Clark Air Base in the Philippines and fly some 460 miles west to three reefs -- Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief -- which Beijing has rapidly been transforming into expansive islands and, the U.S. fears, soon-to-be permanent military stations 600 miles from China's coastline. From the air, the waters appear quiet and peaceful, but 60% of world trade traffics through here. And underneath the sea floor are believed to be enormous deposits of oil and gas. That helps explain the international free-for-all underway to claim an array of barely visible reefs and shoals. It's not only China but also the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Indonesia and Brunei that are involved. Though the coastlines of the other countries are all closer than China's, they are still more than 200 miles away, far from their territorial waters, which by international law extend only 12 miles out from shore. America's own coastline is, of course, thousands of miles away, but the U.S. is still very much in the mix. It's the defender, in effect, of free passage through international waters for all international cargo ships and, crucially, the U.S. Navy. Forty-five minutes into the flight, the first mission target comes into view: Subi Reef. More than two dozen Chinese dredgers fill the lagoon, pumping sand from the ocean floor in huge plumes onto the surface, slowly and gradually building up an island from scratch. The scale and pace of their work is mesmerizing. In two years, China has expanded the surface area of reefs it claims in the South China Sea from just five acres to more than 2,000. The P8 crew expect the Chinese navy to warn them away as we approach. Usually these "challenges," as they refer to them, come once the jet is within a few miles, and indeed, the radio soon relays a voice speaking in Chinese-accented English: "This is the Chinese navy. This is the Chinese navy ... Please leave immediately to avoid misunderstanding." From both sides, the communication is calm and, mostly, professional. The American pilot quickly responds from a well-rehearsed script explaining that this is a U.S. aircraft operating in international airspace over international waters. U.S. threatens peace in South China Sea, Beijing says Still, as the Chinese navy radio operators come back on the line to repeat their warning, I can hear frustration building in their voices. In one case, the operator's voice grows louder and louder, ending in a high-pitched "You go!" The Chinese give warnings like this eight times during the flight. It turns out there are also civilian aircraft in the vicinity. A Delta Air Lines flight on that same frequency hears the Chinese challenge, and then pipes into the frequency to ask what's going on. The Chinese navy radio operator identifies himself, possibly to reassure them. The flight crew notes that this can be a very nerve-racking experience for civilian aircraft in the area. For now, these Chinese challenges are surface-to-air, coming from new early-warning radar stations they have positioned on the islands or from Chinese navy ships patrolling them. These reefs are too far from air bases in China for Chinese aircraft to intercept the P8 and start a potential confrontation in the air, but that may change if and when these islands have working airstrips. Fact is, China is already on its way. As we leave Subi Reef, we approach Fiery Cross Reef a few minutes travel away. Here China has made the most extensive progress. What used to be a rocky reef barely visible above the waves is now equipped with a nearly completed runway, a tower, an early warning radar station and barracks for Chinese soldiers and sailors. Meanwhile, Chinese dredgers continue to dig away at a deep-water harbor for Chinese ships. This is what some call China's "unsinkable aircraft carrier." If China continues to militarize the islands, as the U.S. fears, the three reefs will form strategic Chinese military bases right in the middle of some of the most contested waters in the world. On board the P8, the mood is calm and confident. These crews have been flying these flights for months now. But the more China builds, the U.S. sailors tell me, the more aggressively the Chinese navy is challenging them. CNN has learned that the U.S. is considering flying its aircraft -- and sailing its Navy warships -- even closer to the islands to further demonstrate that the U.S. does not recognize China's claims. The lowest we fly on this mission is 15,000 feet. But that could soon change. And what happens if China starts deploying its aircraft to these waters? The airstrip on Fiery Cross Reef is already long enough to accommodate every military aircraft in the Chinese arsenal. P8 flights hundreds of miles closer to the mainland are already intercepted by Chinese fighters. Last fall, in one such encounter, the Chinese pilot came dangerously close. The prospect of U.S.-Chinese collisions in the air are truly alarming, as past events have demonstrated. In 2001, a Chinese jet collided with a U.S. EP-3, the P8's predecessor, over Hainan Island, right off the Chinese mainland, leading to a major crisis as the damaged U.S. plane barely managed a safe landing on Chinese territory. The P8 flight crew speaks confidently and calmly about their mission. But they know they are in the midst of a major and contentious potential conflict. Chinese protests are becoming more stern. U.S. surveillance flights and naval patrols are becoming more aggressive. And the two countries' positions are, for now, irreconcilable. China views these islands as its sovereign territory and describes its commitment to them as "unshakable." The U.S. views the area as international waters and airspace. Aboard the P8, it is difficult to see how those differences are resolved.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)A group of armed insurgents attacked a police post in southern Afghanistan, killing 17 officers and wounding two others, an official said Saturday. The attack happened around 11 p.m. (2:30 p.m. ET) Friday in the Musa Qala district of Helmand province, according to Omar Zwak, a spokesman for the provincial governor. Zwak said investigators have been dispatched to the area to find out more about the incident, including how many insurgents, if any, died in the gunfight. Such violence, unfortunately, has plagued Afghanistan for years. Much of it has been spearheaded by the Taliban, the Islamist militant group forced out of power by the U.S.-led invasion following the September 11, 2001, terror attacks but still very much a disruptive force in the Asian nation. Many of the Taliban's targets have been police, troops and government workers. Still, it's not the only militant group to make claims: ISIS said it was behind the deaths of at least 33 people in Jalalabad, where a man on a motorbike blew himself up in front of a Kabul Bank branch. Still, while the latest attack in Helmand aligns with that history, it was not immediately clear who was behind it. This bloodshed has affected many parts of Afghanistan. Earlier this month, militants killed nine aid workers in an attack on a house in Afghanistan's northern Balkh province, according to Abdul Razaq Qaderi, chief of that province's criminal department. And in late May, four Taliban fighters were killed after launching an hours-long gun and grenade attack in an upscale district of central Kabul. No civilians or security forces died in that incident, Afghan Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Ayub Salangi told CNN. In Helmand province, a car bomb targeting the governor's compound killed at least seven people and wounded 46 in March, then-Deputy Governor Jan Rasoolyar said. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said his group was responsible for that attack.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Australian authorities paid smugglers to turn back a boat transporting migrants attempting to reach that nation, the United Nations refugee agency says. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Australian authorities paid smugglers to turn back a boat transporting migrants attempting to reach that nation, the United Nations refugee agency said Friday, citing people on the ship. The boat -- carrying 65 migrants from Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Myanmar -- was intercepted by the Indonesian navy after turning back on May 31, the UNHCR said. The migrants were transferred to an Indonesian customs vessel for four days before being sent on two boats to Indonesia, the UNHCR added, after speaking to some of the passengers. Australia did not deny the payment and Prime Minister Tony Abbott went on the defensive Friday when asked about the claim. Abbott refused to "comment on operational matters." Abbott said in an interview with Radio 3AW that Australia is "determined to ensure that illegal boats don't get to Australia. We will do whatever is reasonably necessary to protect our country from people smuggling and from the effects of this evil and damaging trade that costs lives." When pressed further about whether Australia paid smugglers illegally transporting migrants, Abbott replied "what we do is we stop the boats by hook or by crook because that's what we've got to do and that's what we've successfully done." He said he didn't want to discuss details about the interception, but said it was necessary and indicated it has been done more than once. "It's difficult and at times I suppose it's dangerous work, but we deal with it and we've stopped the boats," he said. Abbott also refused to confirm if Australia would investigate the payment claim. Meanwhile, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service said that during the month of May "there were no illegal maritime arrivals."  </corpo>

            <descricao>Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has described ISIS as a "death cult" that is targeting people and governments with a message to "submit or die."</descricao>
            <corpo>Sydney (CNN)Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott has described ISIS as a "death cult" that is targeting individuals and governments globally with a message to "submit or die" in a speech at the start of a regional counter extremism summit in Sydney today. "This is not terrorism for a local grievance; this is terrorism with global ambitions," Abbott said. "You can't negotiate with an entity like this; you can only fight it." The two-day summit has brought together ministers, senior officials and observers from 27 countries, along with executives from social media groups including Google, Facebook and Twitter, and will examine ways countries can work regionally to combat extremist terrorism. Delegates to the conference will look at ways they can prevent the distribution of online propaganda and focus on the use of social media to recruit ISIS followers and radicalize young people.  Recently Australia has taken measures to combat terrorism, including a controversial move to strip citizenship from known terrorists who are dual Australian nationals. The passports of 115 Australians have been canceled, nine others whose travel plans had been "suspect" have been suspended, and 14 passport applications have been refused. Abbott said a prime aim of the conference was to stop young people succumbing to the lure of online recruiters. "Above all, we need idealistic young people to appreciate that joining this death cult is an utterly misguided and wrong-headed way to express their desire to sacrifice," he said.  Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said any solution should focus on the important role women can play in combating the "radicalization process." Bishop said women now account for one fifth of all foreign fighters joining ISIS. "Women are fighting, joining their foreign fighter husbands, seeking to find partners or are otherwise providing support for terrorist organizations," she said. Bishop said "it defies all comprehension" that women -- one of biggest victims of ISIS -- continue to support extremist groups. "It is vital that we remove any romanticism or idealism about the motives of groups like Da'esh (ISIS) -- who are not freedom fighters or religious warriors -- they are criminal gangs that extort money, murder innocent people and commit crimes such as the rape of women and children."

            <cabecalho>Chinese feminists show off armpit hair in photo contest - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>In the fight against domestic violence and gender inequality, Chinese feminists have opened up a new battlefront: Their armpits. </descricao>
            <corpo>Beijing (CNN)In the fight against domestic violence and gender inequality, Chinese feminists have opened up a new battlefront: Their armpits. They ask, why should women have to shave their pits when men are never expected to? To subvert the double standard, feminist Xiao Meili, 25, started an armpit hair photo contest on Chinese social network Weibo. Dozens of women have participated, including three of the five feminists briefly arrested in March over a protest for gender equality. The participants sent in selfies and glamor shots with their arms proudly raised, revealing natural hair underneath. "Women should have the right to decide how to deal with their bodies, including small details like armpit hair," Xiao tells CNN. "You can choose to shave it, but you shouldn't be forced to do so under the pressure of stereotypes." Six winners will be selected from the photo competition, which ends Wednesday. Prizes include condoms, vibrators and a pedestal urinal that a woman can use while standing.  Xiao, who became a feminist in college after reading female authors like Simone de Beauvoir, says the aesthetics of silky smooth armpits didn't become popular in China until around 20 years ago, as American influences swept into the country. Before that, nobody thought showing armpit hair was an issue. As a small child, Xiao recalled her mother's indifference over armpit hair. "She said, 'I don't have much of it. Plus it will eventually shed years later. Why would I bother removing it?'" These days, shaving has become the norm for China women -- but it's not right, says Xiao. "The media coverage on female celebrities' underarms is disgusting, as if women shouldn't have hair or it's something to be ashamed of, while male celebrities openly show off their armpit hair." As one participant says beneath her photo submission: "I love my armpit hair. It's part of my body. I hope girls can show off their armpit hair without fear."  To Xiao, concern over the armpit hair issue isn't trivial -- it's a matter of principle. "Some people question why I make a fuss about the hair. They say there are more important issues that need to be solved like domestic violence and sexual assault. I think they are equally important. They're all about fighting for gender equality." Xiao has tackled other issues concerning women. Last year, she walked more than 1,200 miles across China, sending letters to officials in each city she visited to raise awareness of sex abuse in Chinese schools. Before that, she has staged public art performances to protest everything from violence against women to unfair ratios of male-to-female public restrooms. But it hasn't been easy. In March, five of her friends, fellow activists, were detained after planning a protest in Beijing to counter sexual harassment on public transportation. They were only released a month later after news had spread around the world, leading even Hillary Clinton to condemn the arrests.  Although China's current regime was founded on values of gender equality -- Mao Zedong banned old practices such as the binding of women's feet, and famously declared "In China, women hold up half the sky," -- women in today's China face violence and discrimination. According to a 2013 U.N. report, over half of men surveyed in China said they had committed an act of violence against a woman, and over one-fifth confessed to raping a woman. At the same time, women face extreme pressure to marry early, or else risk becoming a "leftover woman." Women who remain single, or fall outside beauty standards, are mocked as "manly women" -- sometimes on national television. And women remain underrepresented in leadership fields: No woman has ever reached China's Standing Committee, the country's highest-ranking political body. No matter: Xiao says she is determined to see the fight through. "Gender discrimination exists wherever there are people," she says. "Something needs to be done. We want our voices heard."  </corpo>

            <descricao>Iranian nuclear negotiations are getting increasingly difficult and the deadline for a deal may need to be extended, officials said Friday.</descricao>
            <corpo>Washington (CNN)Iranian nuclear negotiations are getting increasingly difficult as diplomats stare down a fast-approaching deadline at the end of the month -- a deadline officials said may need to be extended. A senior U.S. official and Western diplomat downplayed a report from the Russian news agency Tass, which quoted a diplomat as saying talks are "virtually stalled." The two officials instead told CNN Friday that negotiations are tough, as expected, but continue to move forward. But the two sources said that the talks are at a delicate moment and that negotiations may have to be extended a few days past the June 30 deadline. Nobody in the room is yet talking about a full-scale extension, they added. The United States and five other world powers are negotiating with Iran to curb the country's nuclear program and keep it from building a nuclear bomb. Iran has insisted that its nuclear program is peaceful, and in April the parties reached a framework to hash out the details of a final deal. Sanctions relief for Iran and the level of access inspectors will have in that country continue to be major sticking points in the negotiations. Iran wants near immediate sanctions relief, while Western officials are wary of lifting sanctions too quickly as they keep an eye on Iran's activities in the early months after a deal is reached. Western diplomats are also pushing for unprecedented levels of access that would allow international inspectors to visit any facility in Iran suspected of nuclear activity, including military sites. Tehran has strongly pushed back on that level of access, looking to keep military sites off limits. World powers also want Iran to come clean about any past efforts to develop a military dimension to its nuclear program. Although it seems unlikely that that issue will be fully resolved before any deal is reached, U.S. officials and European diplomats insist sanctions relief will be tied to Iran satisfying lingering questions from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN nuclear watchdog. One incentive the sides have to reach an agreement by the deadline or shortly thereafter: An extremely skeptical Congress will have 30 days to review a final nuclear deal with Iran -- a period that will be doubled if a deal isn't reached by July 9.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>HRW: Another 50 lashes imminent for Saudi blogger - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Saudi blogger Raif Badawi is due to receive a round of 50 lashes any day, part of his sentence of 10 years in jail and 1,000 lashes with a cane for comments on his blog.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Raif Badawi set up a website to express his views and those of others. For that he was sentenced to 10 years in jail and 1,000 lashes with a whipping cane. To Saudi Arabian authorities, the blogger is a criminal. And for that, he is to be publicly flogged -- as happened in January, when he stoically arched his back in pain while getting 50 lashes. He's supposed to get 19 more rounds of such punishment, according to the advocacy group Human Rights Watch. The second batch of 50 lashes was supposed to come not long after the first, but it's been pushed back several times -- including Friday. Amnesty reported as much on Twitter, as did Badawi's wife Ensaf Haidar. "No flogging for today," Haidar wrote on her husband's Twitter account. "I repeat my appeal to his majesty King Salman to pardon my husband #RaifBadawi and stop his flogging."  Badawi has been behind bars since 2012 for his online posts and running a blog called "Saudi Arabian Liberals," where he hosted political and religious debate and advocated secularism in a highly religious society. In 2013, a court originally sentenced him to seven years and 600 lashes, but the punishment was upped upon appeal, Human Rights Watch has said. The sharper measures also includes a fine of about $265,000, the group said. The sentencing covers convictions for violating the kingdom's information technology law, insulting Islam, and according to HRW, "blasphemous phrases on his Facebook page and disobedience to his father." On Monday, Saudi Arabia's Supreme Court upheld the sentence, now Badawi has no more appeals.  The lashings were supposed to happen about once a week for 20 weeks, in a place open to public viewing. A light wooden cane is used for the lashes, which are administered on the legs and back, HRW said. They usually leave bruises but don't often break the skin. But eight days after the initial flogging, doctors determined that Badawi's injuries had not healed sufficiently to be flogged for the second time, Amnesty International reported. Another round would be detrimental, they said. The second beating has been postponed many times, including on Friday. "His health is poor, and he cannot take another round of lashes," Badawi's wife, Haidar, told Amnesty then.  On top of health concerns, the first lashing ignited international outcry from human rights activists and from Western governments. Before the supreme court decision, U.S. officials had called on Saudi officials to withdraw the sentence and review Badawi's case. Human Rights Watch said in protest at the time, "Publicly lashing a peaceful activist merely for expressing his ideas sends an ugly message of intolerance."

            <cabecalho>Actor Enright in Syria: Kurds need help against ISIS - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>British actor Michael Enright, who's volunteering with Kurdish fighters in Syria, says they need help to combat ISIS and denies claims he is a liability.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)For British actor Michael Enright, the release of video footage by ISIS showing the August killing of U.S. journalist James Foley first motivated him to make the difficult journey into Syria to join the fight against the terror group. "It was heartbreaking, it was shocking, it made me angry," he said. The subsequent killings of other hostages from Britain and Japan, and ISIS' persecution of the Yazidi minority in Iraq, only hardened his resolve to help out however he could, he said. The 51-year-old, who's volunteering with Kurdish fighters in Syria, has now appealed for the United Kingdom to give the Kurds more help in their battle against the Sunni extremists. Speaking to CNN from Rojava, a Kurdish enclave in northern Syria, Enright said the Kurdish forces had the heart and will to fight but needed more air support to cut off ISIS supply routes. The actor left Los Angeles in March for Syria, traveling via Turkey and Iraq.  While Enright is clear his mission is to help the Kurds, whom he sees as friends and comrades, others have been more skeptical. Last week, a former U.S. Army serviceman who has turned recruiter for foreigners eager to fight with Kurdish forces against ISIS claimed in a Facebook post that Enright was a liability who is in danger of being killed by his own comrades. Jordan Matson of Sturtevant, Wisconsin, said that Enright had been kicked out of four fighting units and had been asked to leave twice by the Kurdish People's Protection Units, or YPG. He also questioned the actor's state of mind, said he was carrying around an AK-47 that had been disabled by his own side, and suggested Enright was there writing a movie script. Matson repeated some of these claims directly to CNN, which reported on the Facebook post, via an online chat forum. A second American fighting with the YPG also told CNN that Westerners had made threats against Enright. Kurdish forces in Iraq and Syria have been among the most effective counterbalances to ISIS' expansion. In Syria, the YPG's high-profile battle to keep the town of Kobani from ISIS control dominated news coverage last year.  Enright declined to name anyone behind the negative media coverage last week. But he insisted the claims made were not based on fact and said he was baffled by the coverage of what he described as "tittle-tattle" and Internet gossip. He has two cameras with him, Enright said, and the Kurds -- having learned that he was an actor who had worked in TV and movies -- asked him to film what was going on. While in Hollywood, the actor played small parts in "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," "Old Dogs" and "Knight and Day." "I've not been asked to leave by four generals, I've not put a gun in my mouth or wanted to kill myself, I've not been threatened in any way by the Kurds," Enright said. "I love the Kurds and the unit I'm in is the best -- it's something about being in a situation like this (that) brings out something very special, definitely, in me and in the lads that I could never replicate in civilian life." He also said his gun was "just fine" and that he had never started writing a movie script and had no plans to do so. "This is about the evil that is called ISIS and exterminating it from the face of the earth," he said, in response to claims he was interested in self-promotion. "It's about substantial things, real things." Enright, originally from Manchester in northern England, said he was concerned about the impact of the negative coverage on his family back home, explaining that was the reason he was speaking to the media again now. The real story is the suffering of the Syrian people and the efforts of the Kurds to push back ISIS, he said. Asked by CNN about Enright's rejection of his claims, Matson stood by what he had said. CNN has reached out to the YPG for comment but has not yet had a response. American killed fighting against ISIS  Enright called on the UK government under Prime Minister David Cameron to revisit its decision not to deploy air support for anti-ISIS fighters in Syria. Britain launched its first airstrikes against ISIS in Iraq last fall, following authorization from the UK Parliament. But the motion passed by lawmakers stipulated that any proposal to expand the strikes to Syria would require additional action by Parliament. Enright said that the Kurds were being hampered in their fight by the continued existence of ISIS-controlled territory between the areas they control -- the Kurdish cantons of Kobani, Cizire and Efrin -- which allow the Sunni extremists to maintain supply lines from over the Turkish border. He had seen evidence of this firsthand in villages the Kurds liberated from ISIS, he said, where the extremists left behind packaging for food from Turkey. "I know (Cameron) has a lot on his plate right now with the European Union, Ukraine, but if it's possible we really, really do need help," he said. As for his own role in Syria, Enright said he was not making plans for the future but had made a commitment to stay until ISIS was completely pushed out of Rojava.

            <corpo>Jerusalem (CNN)The Israeli military announced on Thursday that it will not take any legal action against those involved in a deadly airstrike on a beach last year. The July 2014 attack on the Gaza City beach killed four boys, aged between 9 and 11, from the extended Bakr family. Their names were Ismail, Zakariya, Ahed and Mohammad. "The Military Advocate General found that the attack process in question accorded with Israeli domestic law and international law requirements. The decision to attack was taken by the competent authorities, and the attack was aimed at figures who were understood to be militants from Hamas's Naval Forces, who had gathered in order to prepare to carry out military activities against the IDF (Israel Defense Forces)," according to the report from the IDF military advocate general, Maj. Gen. Danny Efroni. Investigators interviewed IDF soldiers involved in planning and carrying out the attack, and they examined documents and video of the attack, according to the report. Investigators also tried to interview three Palestinian witnesses in Gaza, but the report says the witnesses declined to speak with investigators, instead offering affidavits. The location of the attack was known to be a compound of Hamas police and naval forces, which the IDF attacked multiple times in the days before the attack that killed the four children, according to the report. When IDF aerial surveillance spotted four people running towards a shed next to the compound, officials believed them to be Hamas militants, the report says. The IDF struck the area with two missiles, killing the children. "Tragically, in the wake of the incident it became clear that the outcome of the attack was the death of four children who had entered the military compound for reasons that remain unclear," the report states. There will be "no further legal proceedings" against those involved in the incident, according to the report, but "as a result of this incident, the IDF has been working to improve a number of its operational capabilities, including technological capabilities, in order to minimize the risk of the recurrence of tragic incidents of this kind," it says.  The IDF also issued indictments against three soldiers for looting a Palestinian home during the Gaza war. According to Efroni's report, the soldiers looted $350 from a home in the Shuja'iyya neighborhood in which they were staying. Two soldiers are charged with looting the home while a third is charged with obstruction of justice. Efroni opened three more criminal investigations, including one in which nine people were killed at a cafe on the Khan Younis coast on July 9. Investigators will also look into allegations of abuse against a Palestinian detainee who claims IDF forces assaulted him for no reason after he was captured, and into media reports of IDF tanks intentionally firing shells at a medical clinic. According to the report, the advocate general has looked into approximately 190 incidents from the Gaza war. Dozens of additional incidents remain under investigation. The last Gaza war began when three Israeli teens were abducted and murdered. Israel blamed Hamas. The retaliatory abduction and murder of a Palestinian teen wound tensions in the region to a fever pitch. There followed a dramatic escalation in the number of rockets Hamas was firing into Israel and after a failed attempt by militants to storm into its territory, Israel launched the so-called Operation Protective Edge. The war lasted 50 days and by the time a ceasefire was agreed, some 2,100 Palestinians, and 68 Israelis, mostly soldiers, had been killed.

            <corpo>(CNN)The United States announced the transfer of six detainees from Guantanamo Bay to Oman as part of an effort to eventually close the detention center in Cuba. All six detainees are Yemeni, and include alleged members of the al Qaeda terror group. With the latest transfer, 116 detainees remain at the facility as the clock ticks toward the end of President Barack Obama's term. Obama signed an executive order on his third day in office in January 2009 to begin the process of shutting down Guantanamo Bay. "The United States is grateful to the government of Oman for its humanitarian gesture and willingness to support ongoing U.S. efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay detention facility," the Defense Department said in a statement. Inmate's book exposes horrors of Gitmo The United States tries to find countries that will provide security against possible trouble from former prisoners and human rights assurances regarding the former inmates. Six federal departments and agencies that comprise the task force reviewing the Guantanamo camp unanimously approved the transfer, the statement said. Detainees from nations actively battling Islamist extremists -- such as Yemen -- are not released to their countries to ensure they don't join terror groups there. The detainees transferred to Oman on Friday are Idris Ahmad 'Abd Al Qadir Idris, Sharaf Ahmad Muhammad Mas'ud, Jalal Salam Awad Awad, Saa'd Nasser Moqbil Al Azani, Emad Abdallah Hassan, and Muhammad Ali Salem Al Zarnuki.

            <descricao>A movement to boycott Israel for its activities in the West Bank and Gaza is growing, prompting Israel's government to announce it will fight back.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)A movement to boycott Israel for its activities in the West Bank and Gaza is growing in popularity, and Israel's government is vowing to fight back. The boycott movement, called BDS, which stands for Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, opposes what it says is an Israeli system of discrimination against Palestinians. BDS has activists working in many countries, and the movement has tens of thousands of followers on social media. Co-founder Omar Barghouti said BDS is growing quickly -- at least in part because of the formation of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's right-wing government.  The BDS movement has made front-page headlines in Israel, especially after Stéphane Richard, CEO of Orange, a French telecommunications company, said last week in Cairo that he would cut ties with the company's Israeli partner "tomorrow" if he could. Orange has been a target of the BDS movement for its business in the West Bank, but Richard insisted his comments were not related to the BDS movement. Instead, he said his comments related to Orange's business in Israel. Israeli company Partner Communications uses the Orange brand name in Israel. Orange issued a statement following Richard's remarks, saying, "In line with its brand development strategy, Orange does not wish to maintain the presence of the brand in countries in which it is not, or is no longer, an operator. In this context, and while strictly adhering to existing agreements, the Group ultimately wishes to end this brand license agreement." Netanyahu and other Israeli politicians blasted Richard's comments, calling for the French government, which owns part of Orange, to condemn the statements. "I call on the French government to publicly repudiate the miserable statement and miserable action by a company that is under its partial ownership," Netanyahu said. Richard apologized for his remarks and said he was misunderstood. He is expected in Israel this week to clarify his comments, according to the Prime Minister's office. Even with Richard's apology, BDS co-founder Barghouti said such statements are a partial success for the movement. "It is a beginning of a success, but we don't take seriously what CEOs of companies say. We take seriously what they actually do." Barghouti said BDS activists will keep protesting against Orange until the company ends its agreement with Partner Communications.  To counter the growing influence of the movement, Jewish-American billionaires and political mega-donors Sheldon Adelson and Haim Saban bridged their political differences -- Adelson is a Republican, Saban a Democrat -- and pledged to start and fund an anti-boycott movement. "This isn't over. This is just the beginning," Saban told Channel 2 Israel about the Orange CEO and the boycott movement. "Any company that chooses to boycott business in Israel is going to look at this case, and once we're done, they're going to think twice whether they want to take on Israel or not. Trust me, this is just the beginning." Netanyahu also promised to go on the offensive against the movement. "We will gather forces in Israel and around the world to shatter the lies of our enemies, and we will fight for Israel's right to live in peace and security, to live at all," Netanyahu said. Critics of the movement have accused Barghouti and his followers of racism and anti-Semitism. Barghouti denies the allegations. "We are targeting a system of injustice. This should never be conflated with an attack on any group of people based on their identity," Barghouti said. "BDS targets institutions, complicit institutions, not individuals."  Israel's economy will take a $15 billion hit from BDS and similar nonviolent resistance, largely because of the success of the movement in Europe, according to a new study from the RAND Corp. titled "The Costs of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict." The study also said the Palestinians will lose about $2.4 billion. But Barghouti said the price is worth it.  </corpo>

            <descricao>An Egyptian court sentenced 11 men to death for involvement in deadly Port Said riots in 2012 that left more than 70 dead, according to Egyptian state TV.</descricao>
            <corpo>Cairo (CNN)An Egyptian court sentenced 11 men to death Tuesday for their involvement in the worst soccer violence in Egypt's history, according to a broadcast on Egyptian state TV. More than 70 people, some of them children, were killed on February 1, 2012, when fans rioted at a soccer game in the northeastern city of Port Said. Fans of the hometown Al-Masry club stormed the field after securing a win over Cairo's Al-Ahly club. Horrified witnesses described how police officers stood by and watched as rival fans attacked one another with rocks, knives and swords. The 11 sentenced to death in a retrial of the case were connected to Al-Masry. They will be able to appeal their sentences, state media reported. Forty other people received prison sentences in the case. The morning after the riots, the stadium looked like a scene from a horror film, with blood splattered on seats and walls. Dozens of shoes were left near a gate ripped from its hinges by the pressure of a surging crowd trying to escape. Al-Ahly fans blamed police for what happened. The head of the Port Said security directorate and head of maritime police both received five-year sentences over the deadly violence. After the Port Said incident, Egypt banned soccer fans from games, and teams played in nearly empty stadiums. Authorities later partially lifted the ban by allowing a limited number of fans to attend games, state media reported. Unfortunately, Egypt remains no stranger to soccer violence. Last February, 19 people were killed in a crush involving Zamalek club soccer fans. Authorities blamed the deaths on ticketless fans who tried to push their way in to the game. But Zamalek fans painted a different picture, saying on social media that they were tear gassed as they tried to pass through a single, narrow gated entrance.

            <corpo>(CNN)Saudi Arabia's Supreme Court upheld a sentence of 10 years imprisonment and 1,000 lashes for blogger Raif Badawi, his sister, Samar Badawi, said Monday. Badawi's sister went to the Jeddah court Monday to follow up on a local media report that an appeal was denied. There, she received confirmation from the court that the sentence was upheld. Badawi who has been imprisoned since 2012, was charged with violating Saudi Arabia's information technology law and insulting Islam through his website "Saudi Arabian Liberals." The lashings are to be carried out 50 lashes at a time, 20 weeks in a row. Badawi endured the first 50 of the 1,000 lashes stoically in January, arching his back in pain. The flogging provoked an outcry from human rights groups and U.S. officials. "Publicly lashing a peaceful activist merely for expressing his ideas sends an ugly message of intolerance," Human Rights Watch said at the time. And Said Boumedouha, Amnesty International's deputy director for the Middle East, called for Badawi's immediate release. "Raif Badawi is a prisoner of conscience; his only 'crime' was to exercise his right to freedom of expression by setting up a website for public discussion," Boumedouha said in a statement. In a statement posted on the Amnesty website, Badawi's wife, Ensaf Haidar, called for the sentence to be lifted. "Raif told me he is in a lot of pain," Haidar said. "He said that when he was being flogged he took the pain silently and rose above it, so that history will know that he did not react to their punishment. His health is poor and he cannot take another round of lashes." U.S. officials have called on Saudi officials to withdraw the sentence and review Badawi's case. On his "Saudi Arabian Liberals" site, Badawi, hosted political debates and advocated secularism, which he said "respects everyone and does not offend anyone." Amnesty reported that eight days after the initial flogging, doctors determined that Badawi had not healed sufficiently to be flogged for the second time. The lashes have been postponed at least three times. "A medical committee of around eight doctors carried out a series of tests on Raif on 21 January at a Jeddah hospital, and found that wounds sustained from the 50 lashes dealt to him by Saudi officials nearly a fortnight before hadn't healed enough for him to be lashed again without serious risk to Raif's health," the rights group said. CNN's Zahraa Alkhalisi and Eliott C. McLaughlin contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <descricao>ISIS presents a very formidable enemy, one that the international community must fight together. </descricao>
            <corpo>Zainab Hawa Bangura is the United Nations special representative of the secretary general on sexual violence in conflict and serves as the United Nations' spokesperson and political advocate on conflict-related sexual violence. The views expressed are her own. (CNN)Nothing prepared me for what I saw and heard when I visited refugees from the conflict with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. As I traveled to Iraq and Syria, and to neighboring countries of Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey to meet with refugees and displaced women, I heard firsthand the horrifying stories of how they have been targeted in this conflict. I was told, for example, how mothers with babies were separated out by members of ISIL (also known as ISIS) because it is the younger women who they want to take. I heard how these younger women are examined to see if they are virgins, and how the younger and prettier they are, the more likely they are to get taken to ISIL's headquarters in Raqqa. And I heard how the rest are taken to open markets, where they will end up being auctioned after being examined like cattle. I was in the Middle East as the special representative of the secretary general on sexual violence in conflict, and while I had been monitoring the situation since the crisis began, this was the first time I was able to visit those who have been disproportionately affected by the conflict. The refugees and displaced women and girls I met told me how sexual violence is being committed strategically, in a systematic manner, and with a high degree of sophistication by most of the parties to the conflicts. Indeed, as I moved from country to country, I came to the terrible conclusion that this is in essence a war on women and girls, a group that finds itself under assault every day, and every step of the way, whether it be in areas of active conflict, those under control of armed actors, or at checkpoints and border crossings. But while it is true that most parties to the conflict are committing sexual violence, it is extremist groups like ISIL that have been particularly public and shameless in institutionalizing sexual violence and engaging in the brutalization of women and girls as a tactic of terror to advance their key strategic objectives. ISIS: Enslaving, having sex with 'unbelieving' women, girls is OK For a start, it is clear that ISIL has been working to increase recruitment by promising male fighters access to women and girls. In addition, the group has been raising funds through the sale of women and girls in slave markets and through ransoms paid by relatives. And the group has also been using sexual violence to displace populations, while also using the threat of sexual violence to extract information for intelligence purposes. Women and girls I spoke with described being treated as property to be owned and traded, or else as vessels for producing children for fighters. In ISIL strongholds in Syria and Iraq, Raqqa and Mosul, women and girls are held in houses and buildings before they are inspected, selected and sold in "bazaars" where prices can be negotiated. Simply put, we have been witnessing the revival of the slave trade in the 21st century. What can and should we do? Such extreme violence requires political and security responses, but also legal and social response. For a start, all parties to the conflicts, both state and nonstate actors, have an obligation under international humanitarian law to prevent and punish such crimes. Second, U.N. agencies need greater support to be able to provide the necessary assistance and to be able to respond to the needs of the affected population, particularly women and girls who are suffering even in the places where they are seeking refuge. The reality is that the humanitarian appeals dealing with the provision of services to sexual violence survivors are underfunded, and neighboring countries are now also under tremendous pressure. Greater support is therefore needed not only for programs for refugees, but also to support host communities of neighboring countries that have absorbed an estimated 80% of the refugees. 'Treated like cattle': Yazidi women sold, raped, enslaved by ISIS To address the transnational nature of ISIL, and the cross-border dimensions of the conflicts raging in the region, a concerted regional and international response is required, including improved information sharing across countries and a common counterterrorism response with women's protection and empowerment at its heart. Such a response should also look at the root causes of violent extremism, something that we cannot ignore any longer. Preventing abuses will require deeper engagement with communities, including with traditional and religious leaders who can help break the silence surrounding sexual violence and ensure that it is the perpetrators who are shamed and stigmatized, not the victims. In fact, if there was a glimmer of hope during my visit, it was the statement issued by the supreme spiritual leader of the Yazidi community, who said that women and girls released from ISIL captivity should be embraced and reintegrated by their families and communities. Countering ISIL's violent ideology will mean accepting these women and girls -- and any children they may have -- in a spirit of tolerance, dignity and respect. Ultimately, we cannot beat ISIL without understanding who they are, where they come from, and what their ideology is. The group presents a very formidable enemy, one that we must fight together.

            <descricao>Police thwarted an attack at the Karnak Temple in Luxor, Egypt, on Wednesday, killing two of three armed assailants, the country's Interior Ministry said.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Two assailants were killed and one injured in a thwarted attack at Karnak Temple in Luxor, Egypt, on Wednesday morning, authorities said. The attackers confronted security officials at Karnak with firearms and explosives, Egypt's Interior Ministry said in a statement. The three men, who were in a car, tried to enter the temple's parking lot when a plainclothes policeman forced it to stop, Egypt's Tourism Ministry said. Security forces confronted them, and two were killed: one died when he detonated the explosives he was carrying, and another was shot in the head, the Interior Ministry added. The third militant was injured. Egypt's Health Ministry said in a statement that five people were injured, including civilians. "The policeman who stopped the vehicle sustained minor injuries, but due to his heroic actions, many other potential victims were saved and thankfully no tourists were harmed," Tourism Minister Khaled Rami said. Typically, thousands of tourists visit Luxor and Karnak Temple daily. After the attack, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ordered an intensified security presence at vital sites in the country, including sites of antiquity, el-Sisi's office told CNN. Egypt's minister of antiquity and minister of tourism were in Luxor on Wednesday to assess the situation. This is the first deadly attack on a Luxor tourist site since 1997, when gunmen killed 62 people -- most of them international tourists.  The recent targeting of tourist sites represents a major escalation by Islamist militants in Egypt. Last week, gunmen shot and killed two police officers in an attack a few hundred meters from the Great Pyramids of Giza, the Interior Ministry said. Previously, militants, including the ISIS-aligned Ansar Beit Al Maqdis, mostly targeted Egyptian government officials and security forces. But four people were killed and 14 wounded when Ansar Beit Al Maqdis targeted a bus of South Korean tourists traveling from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula into Israel in February 2014. Militants have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers since the overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Morsy in July 2013. Recently, they expanded their targets to include judges. Wednesday's attack coincided with the signing of the African Tripartite Free Trade Agreement in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Several African leaders, including el-Sisi, are attending the summit in the Sinai Peninsula, hundreds of kilometers away from the site of Wednesday's attack. In a post last month on its official Arabic website, the Muslim Brotherhood appeared to endorse a call to arms by urging followers to "resist this coup by all means until the fall of the regime" and asserted the "legitimate right to self-defense." Security forces have arrested anyone belonging to or accused of working with the Brotherhood, a group designated by Egypt as a terrorist organization. Hundreds of Islamists and their supporters have been killed in the crackdown.  The Egyptian government has been trying to lure back tourists for the summer high season. Tourism represents 11.3% of Egypt's gross domestic product and 19.3% of its foreign currency revenues, Egypt's State Information Services says. "The government of Egypt places the highest priority on the safety of tourists in our country," said Rami, the tourism minister. "We have enhanced security measures in place at all our sites, and we continue to take every possible measure to ensure that no harm comes to anyone visiting Egypt."  </corpo>

            <descricao>President Barack Obama's administration is considering sending about 500 additional forces to Iraq, with many of them focused on training Iraqi troops.</descricao>
            <corpo>Washington (CNN)President Barack Obama's administration is planning to train Sunni tribes' fighters as part of its move to send up to 450 additional U.S. forces to Iraq, the White House said Wednesday. The United States is also sending weapons to Sunni tribes, as well as the Kurdish Peshmerga fighters, who are operating under Iraqi command, in order to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. The hope, an Obama administration official said, is that a new "Sunni uprising" similar to one that took place in 2013 will occur - but this time, aimed at Islamic State fighters. "This is designed to focus on training the Sunnis," the official said. The additional U.S. military personnel will train and advise Iraqi and tribal troops at the Taqaddum military base in eastern Anbar province. Sunni fighters will continue with the standard practice of undergoing a security review by the Iraq's before they are permitted to join, to ensure they do not have loyalties to ISIS, the official said. RELATED: Obama says 'no complete strategy' in training Iraqi troops The Associated Press was the first to report earlier Tuesday that the administration was considering sending up to 1,000 U.S. forces to the country. Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey told reporters traveling with him in Jerusalem on Tuesday that Obama has asked military brass to "take a look at what we've learned over the last eight months in the train-and-equip program and make recommendations to him on whether there are capabilities that we may want to provide to the Iraqis to actually make them more capable." RELATED: Rumsfeld defends remarks about democracy in Iraq "He's asked us to look at whether there are other locations where we might establish training sites," Dempsey said. "He's asked us to take a look at how we might develop Iraq's leaders." There are currently about 3,050 U.S. forces in Iraq. Roughly 2,250 of them are devoted to supporting Iraqi security forces, approximately 450 are training Iraqi troops and about 200 more are acting in advising and assisting roles.

            <cabecalho>Lost comet lander Philae sends 'hello' from space - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Philae is alive! The lost comet lander from the Rosetta spacecraft signals ESA's operations center in Germany.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's alive! Many moons ago, a small space probe named Philae skipped across the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko when the lander's harpoon-like anchoring mechanism failed. It came to rest in a shady spot and, without enough sunlight to keep it powered, it fell asleep after about 60 hours of operation. Mission scientists had been trying to pinpoint its location since November -- until late Saturday. At 10:28 p.m., the European Space Agency's operations center in Darmstadt, Germany, just south of Frankfurt, received a signal from Philae, which transmitted more than 300 data packets. Those have been analyzed at the Lander Control Center at the German Aerospace Center, which dubbed Philae's emergence from its seven-month slumber a "'hello' from space." "Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35ºC and has 24 watts available," Philae project manager Stephan Ulamec said in a statement. "The lander is ready for operations." To hear Twitter tell it, Philae's comet-chasing mothership, Rosetta, was delighted to hear from the little lander but reluctant to let it delve back into work too hastily after its long sleep. Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter "Hello @ESA_Rosetta! I'm awake! How long have I been asleep? #Lifeonacomet," came the tweet from Philae's handle. "Hello @Philae2014! You've had a long sleep, about 7 months!" Rosetta responded. "Wow @ESA_Rosetta! That's a long time... time for me to get back to work! #Lifeonacomet" "@Philae2014 Need to check you're fit, healthy and warm enough first @philae2014! Take it easy for now :)" "Oh, OK @ESA_Rosetta! I'm still a bit tired anyway... talk to you later! Back to #lifeonacomet!" Months after Philae nodded off, lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needed almost 6 watts of power to reboot itself, 9 watts to accept communications and 19 watts to allow two-way communication with the orbiter -- not a great deal of power when you consider energy-saving lightbulbs use 20 watts or fewer. There was speculation in March that Philae could be awake but lacking the necessary power to communicate with Rosetta, which was in orbit around Comet 67P looking for the washing machine-sized lander. Scientists sent "blind commands" in hopes that the lander could process the instructions even if it couldn't respond, O'Rourke told CNN in March. But there was not immense confidence that Philae could be revived. Asked his thoughts Sunday, O'Rourke told CNN he was "thrilled" contact was re-established, which "allows us to do more science." "We are all delighted -- delighted that Philae survived the long winter. It's a great opportunity," he said. When the lander snapped its hibernation spell Saturday, it "spoke" with the scientists on the ground for 85 seconds, ESA said. "We have also received historical data -- so far, however, the lander had not been able to contact us earlier," Ulamec said, explaining that Philae must have been awake before Saturday night. Scientists eagerly anticipate Philae's next contact, as the lander's memory still contains more than 8,000 data packets that will tell them what has happened in recent days on Comet 67P. Since March 12, Rosetta has been listening for the lander to determine if it had survived the cold, dark recesses of the comet. Scientists promised that if enough sunlight could fall on Philae's solar panels, it could be revived. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. The mishap, said scientists, could prove to be a happy accident. Had Philae touched down in its original landing spot, O'Rourke explained, the temperatures as the comet neared the sun could have burned out the lander's electronics, killing it altogether. But because it found shade -- beneath a cliff face, scientists deduced from images sent by the lander -- it was able to survive. Now, scientists are excited at the prospect of Philae witnessing a remarkable show as 67P makes its closest approach to the sun in August. "I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point," O'Rourke has said. ESA has led the consortium, which includes NASA, to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun. The mission is already changing perceptions of comets. Instead of thinking of a comet as a dirty snowball, O'Rourke has said, he now thinks of a comet as an "icy dirtball." He also described discoveries of dust and large "boulders" circling the comet after they were blown off by the sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football field that has been lifted and deposited next to the hole. "The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery," he said. CNN Interactive: Rosetta and its mission Opinion: How comet mission helps search for alien life  </corpo>

            <corpo>Al-Mazraa, Iraq (CNN)Al-Mazraa is a dusty village just south of Baiji, where a battle is raging between ISIS fighters and pro-government Iraqi forces trying to push them out. Under normal circumstances it's a sleepy farming town just off the Saddam Hussein-era highway linking Baghdad and Mosul. Today it's a staging point for pro-government forces heading into nearby Baiji. Battered, bullet-pocked Humvees and armored pick-up trucks rumble through the trash-strewn main street, while young soldiers and militiamen mill around in the shade seeking relief from the brutal mid-day heat. A few residents mix with the fighters, including little boys curious about all the newcomers. A month ago Al-Mazraa, a village of Sunni Arabs, was in the hands of ISIS, but according to resident Ammer Hashd Jraish, their hands were light. "They would drive through here, but never stopped here," he says. Today Jraish, a man in his late forties with the ubiquitous dark moustache and sporting combat fatigues, is a member of the town council. He's a member of the Hashd Al-Shaabi, the Popular Mobilization Units (PMU), a Shia-led paramilitary force partially armed, trained and advised by Iran. Although a Sunni, he -- like many others in Al-Mazraa -- has taken up arms with the Shia-led PMU. Jraish insists he had nothing to do with ISIS during the year they controlled the area. I met him in the PMU's command center in Al-Mazraa, a sitting room in a villa full of chairs with maps on the walls and a big computer screen featuring another map of Baiji and the adjacent refinery. Sitting next to the screen is a man perhaps in his sixties with a trim white beard and white hair. It's Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis, PMU's commander and arguably the most powerful military leader in Iraq. In this war where ironies abound, Al-Muhandis is on the U.S. government's list of designated terrorists for his involvement in the Iraqi insurgency, and for involvement in terrorist acts in Kuwait in the 1980s. But today he, like the United States, is fighting ISIS. CNN producer Hamdi Alkhshali and I introduce ourselves to Al-Muhandis, who initially declines our request for a quick on-camera interview. After a little coaxing, however, he begins to explain the situation in Baiji on one of the maps on the wall, quickly conceding that despite what we were told by Iraqi officials in Baghdad, pro-government forces only control about 50% of the town and still have a way to go before retaking the refinery, Iraq's largest. He is hesitant to be drawn on the United States and its role in the war on ISIS, brushing off questions with "it does not concern me" or "these are agreements between the Iraqi government and the United States." After much pressing, he expresses scorn. "It's clear," he says: "The international coalition isn't serious in its operations. That's why Ramadi fell." Others in the room, including the commander of Iraqi Army operations in Baiji, Major General Jumaa Anad, nod in agreement. Al-Muhandis points to the map, to a bridge over the Tigris River north of Baiji. "This bridge is on the main ISIS supply line between Baiji and Mosul. Every day for months now, fighters, equipment and ammunition move over this bridge. But until now the international coalition hasn't hit it." Major General Anad, a 37-year veteran of the Iraqi Army, expresses the consternation one hears from many in Iraq these days, noting that it took the U.S. and its allies only 22 days to utterly defeat Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003. "When the United States wants to do something, it does it," he tells me. "We fought them twice, in 1991 and 2003. They have incredible capabilities. If they were serious, they could crush ISIS." When I ask him his reaction to the news that the Obama administration will send more than 400 additional troops to train the Iraqi Army, supplementing the around 3,100 already here, he scoffs. "We don't need training, we need weapons. To detect land mines we are using sticks, just like in World War One. The Americans have the latest technology for land mines. That's the kind of help we need." We didn't get a very close look at the fighting in Baiji. Mid-afternoon we ended up on the rooftop of a house commandeered by Sunni PMU fighters about 2.5 kilometers east of the town center. The house was littered with half-eaten meals of rice and meat, hundreds of empty water bottles, clothing strewn all over the place. In one of the rooms a young man applies a bandage to his leg. Explaining the lay of the land before us, local Sunni commander Khalil Awa says, "until now there are skirmishes with the remnants of ISIS, while others are fleeing toward Mosul." Others on the rooftop tell us the ISIS fighters, whom they listen in to on their walkie-talkies, are a mixture of Chechnyans, Central Asians and Iraqis from Mosul. From the rooftop we could hear small arms fire coming from Baiji, and an occasional thud, but could make out little else, everything is second-hand. The haze is too thick.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)A Moroccan magazine has withdrawn its latest edition from the shelves after controversy over a front cover that showed two men at a swimming pool gazing into each other's eyes with the headline, "Should homosexuals be burned?" A statement released by the magazine, Maroc Hebdo (Morocco Weekly), on Friday said its decision to pull the edition -- in paper form and online -- followed "strong reactions" to it, particularly on social media. The statement, issued in the name of editor Mohamed Selhami, also apologized to anyone shocked by the subject matter. "Our publication is not a political editorial that pushes a certain sensationalism or provocative topics that can offend the public," it said. "In this instance, it wanted to show the different sides of a social fact; homosexuality and by extension its status in our society. A debate on today's agenda. Maroc Hebdo wanted in this respect to give an account of this debate." At the same time it announced the edition's withdrawal, the magazine offered "an apology to all readers who could be shocked by this topic and reminds them that it will continue working on opening up a national debate on democracy in our society and the values on which it was founded." Homosexuality is illegal the majority Muslim, North African nation. According to rights group Human Rights Watch, those convicted of homosexual acts under Moroccan law can be sentenced to up to three years in prison and a fine.

            <corpo>Kano, Nigeria (CNN)At least 13 people were killed and 24 others injured in a suicide attack on an abattoir in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri, hours after Boko Haram fighters pounded the city with volleys of rocket-propelled grenades in an attack repelled by troops, an aid official, vigilantes and residents said. A suicide bomber disguised as a customer detonated his explosive vest in a crowd of butchers and shoppers ‎at the abattoir in the Kashuwar Sanu cattle market in the city. "We have evacuated the dead and the injured victims to various hospitals in the city," said Umar Sadiq, head of the Nigeria Red Cross in the city. The attack happened around 1 p.m., when business was at its peak, said vigilante Hamisu Kaka. "The suicide bomber deliberately targeted the most crowded part of the cattle market, the abattoir, and detonated his explosives there, which was from all indication aimed at maximizing casualty," Kaka said. "It was a gory sight. We took time trying to sort out human bodies from raw beef that were scattered all over the place from the explosion," said Ibrahim Shehuri, another vigilante. Nobody has claimed responsibility for the attack, but Boko Haram Islamists have been blamed for a series of similar attacks, including a Saturday suicide attack on a mosque in the city. That attack left 26 people dead and 28 injured. Tuesday's attack came hours after the Islamists bombarded the Ajillari Cross neighborhood of the city with rocket-propelled grenades, residents said. The Islamists fired dozens of RPGs on Ajillari from Moronti village, 3 kilometers away, where their advance on the city was disrupted by a ditch and sand embankment ‎the military dug to prevent Boko Haram infiltration from vulnerable points. Troops responded while a fighter jet bombarded the attackers' positions, forcing them to withdraw, residents said. "They started firing RPGs‎ at 12:45 a.m. from Moronti, which continued 'til 2 a.m., when they were forced to retreat by military fire and aerial bombardment," Ajillari resident Buni Lawan said. No one was hurt in the attack as the missiles fell in the open, according to residents. "We all moved out of our homes to avoid being hit and because it was dark we could see the trajectory of the RPGs, which were red with heat,‎ which enabled us to dodge them," Lawan said in an account supported by other residents. The attack came a day after a similar RPG attack on the nearby Dala neighborhood killed 13 people and injured seven others, according to a vigilante leader and residents.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Calm seas in the southern Mediterranean are prompting a wave of migrant smuggling ships to try to make the crossing from Libya to Italy, a group says.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Calm seas and good weather in the southern Mediterranean are prompting a wave of migrant smuggling ships to attempt the crossing from Libya to Italy, the International Organization for Migration said Sunday, putting many lives at risk. European navies and nongovernmental organizations are struggling to locate and rescue migrants from the rickety ships, and thousands may be pulled to safety Sunday, a spokesman for the organization told CNN. "The numbers are high, and they are rising," Federico Soda said. The warning comes after nearly 3,500 migrants were rescued Saturday. The HMS Bulwark, a British Royal Navy ship, has rescued more than 1,000 migrants on Sunday alone, including 10 pregnant women, a spokeswoman for the UK Defence Ministry told CNN. It is the largest rescue operation the Bulwark has had since deploying to the Mediterranean on May 5, and the numbers are climbing as the operation is still ongoing, she said. The ship has rescued more than 2,700 migrants since it was sent to the Mediterranean. A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, said naval ships from Italy and Spain were also involved in the effort to rescue migrants on Sunday, along with the Italian coast guard. The Italian coast guard has received requests for help from 14 vessels in distress, carrying an estimated 1,500 refugees and migrants, the UNHCR's William Spindler said. They have rescued migrants from 11 vessels, and operations to find the other three boats and rescue those on board continue. Commercial vessels are also being directed to the rescue area to help with the operation, Spindler said. A spokesman for the Italian coast guard, Andrea Sbalbi, earlier said 10 rescue operations were ongoing for migrants at sea in wooden fishing boats and rubber dinghies.  Two German naval ships that coordinated Saturday's rescue of thousands of migrants north of the Libyan coast are on their way to Sicily to drop them off, a spokesman for Germany's Bundeswehr Joint Forces Operation Command told CNN on Sunday. The two ships, the Berlin and the Hessen, picked up 1,411 migrants from four vessels Saturday -- 939 men, 327 women and 145 children. In just one vessel there were 563 migrants, the spokesman said. The Hessen was expected to dock at Palermo and the Berlin at Trapani on Sunday. The ships will be replaced early next week by two new ships from the German navy that are on their way to the Mediterranean. The Irish navy ship LE Eithne, which was involved in Saturday's rescue operation, is returning to Italy with 399 migrants on board -- 280 men, 78 women and 41 children, a spokeswoman for the Irish Defence Forces told CNN on Sunday. The ship is not involved in Sunday's ongoing rescue operation in the Mediterranean. According to the Italian coast guard, the ship is due to bring the migrants to Taranto, in Italy's Puglia region, early Monday.  A dozen ships from several countries, along with at least one private ship, were involved in the rescue operations Saturday, the Italian coast guard said. Ian Ruggier, a member of the humanitarian group Migrant Offshore Aid Station, was on one of the rescue boats. Some rescue ships turned up with rescued migrants already on board, according to Ruggier. That's what happened with one German naval vessel that picked up 301 migrants from an unreported vessel as the German ship was on the way to the larger rescue scene, a spokesman for Bundeswehr Joint Forces Operations Command said. The German ships went to the main site and found seven packed boats -- far more than they expected -- according to the spokesman for the command, which is part of Germany's military. The Italian Interior Ministry reported that several of its ships were involved, including from its coast guard and navy. Some Italian rescue vessels reached the island of Lampedusa on Saturday night. Why migrants head to Mediterranean Risking death at sea over death at home  The prospect of migrants being in jeopardy in the Mediterranean is serious but hardly surprising. People from impoverished and conflict-torn countries such as Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Eritrea have taken to the sea to reach Europe in especially large numbers of late, often putting their fate in the hands of people-smugglers. Many times they haven't made it. Hundreds of migrants died in April when their crammed 66-foot (20-meter) boat capsized roughly 70 miles (113 kilometers) north of Libya. That got a lot of news coverage, but it didn't stop the carnage -- including dozens feared drowned after falling into the Mediterranean last month as a rescue vessel approached, according to the aid organization Save the Children. The United Nations estimates that, as of the end of May, 90,000 refugees and migrants had crossed the Mediterranean into Europe so far this year. Just over half landed in Italy, with roughly 42,000 in Greece and the rest recorded in places such as Spain and Malta. The UNHCR's Spindler said that about 1,850 had died or were missing at sea. 68 migrants found locked in containers at UK port CNN's Livia Borghese, Alexander Felton and Greg Botelho contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <descricao>A parole board will recommend that Oscar Pistorius, convicted in the killing of his girlfriend, be released from prison in August.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)A parole board is set to recommend that the disgraced athlete Oscar Pistorius, convicted in the killing of his girlfriend, be released from prison in August, South Africa's Department of Correctional Services told CNN on Monday. Pistorius, 28, was sentenced in October to five years in prison for culpable homicide in the killing of Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day 2013. In South Africa, culpable homicide means a person was killed unintentionally but unlawfully. Pistorius acknowledged firing shots through the bathroom door in his home, but said he thought there was an intruder in the bathroom rather than his girlfriend. Pistorius' fall from grace was one of the most dramatic since that of O.J. Simpson, the American football player turned sports announcer and movie star, who was charged with murder in the 1994 deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. Simpson was acquitted in a criminal trial but found responsible for the deaths in a subsequent civil suit. Like Simpson, Pistorius was handsome, popular and wealthy from commercial endorsements when the charges were filed. In his 2014 trial, a judge found Pistorius to be not guilty of murder. Prosecutors are appealing that verdict. Both of Pistorius' legs were amputated before his first birthday. In the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, Pistorius became the first athlete with both legs amputated to participate in the Olympic Games, running in the 400-meter race and the 4x400 meter relay. Under South African law, Pistorius must serve at least one-sixth of his sentence -- 10 months -- before being released. The parole board is prepared to recommend that he be released on August 21, 10 months to the day since his sentencing. Steenkamp's parents reportedly wrote a letter to the parole board in protest, calling for accountability. South African broadcaster eNCA published the letter, which read, in part: "As her family, we do not seek to avenge her death and we do not want Mr. Pistorius to suffer; that will not bring her back to us. However a person found guilty of a crime must be held accountable for their actions. "Statistics show that our society is under continuous attack from criminals and murderers. Incarceration of 10 months for taking a life is simply not enough. We fear that this will not send out the proper message and serve as the deterrent it should."  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)It seemed like the number of people contracting Ebola in West Africa was on the decline. But now, officials say that trend has stalled, with dozens of new cases of the deadly virus reported so far this month. Last week, there were 31 new cases of Ebola reported in a growing geographic area in Guinea and Sierra Leone, the World Health Organization said. At the beginning of this week, 14 additional cases were reported. The latest figures mark the second straight week that the number of Ebola cases in West Africa has increased, officials said. Investigators are working to trace how the latest cases of the disease were contracted, the WHO said. "The outbreak is not over and the response efforts must be sustained until we get to zero cases throughout the region and are able to stay at zero for several months," the U.N. Mission for Ebola Emergency Response said Thursday. Last month, officials from the WHO declared Liberia free of the disease. But even as they trumpeted the news, officials warned that outbreaks in Guinea and Sierra Leone ran the risk of bringing the virus back to Liberia, where more than 4,000 people died after contracting Ebola. CNN's Debra Goldschmidt and Azadeh Ansari contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Five things Buhari must tackle now that he's president - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>As Nigeria's new president takes over, one of those who worked to get him elected explains what he needs to do to restore the country's prospects.  </descricao>
            <corpo>Chude Jideonwo is managing partner of Red Media Africa, which runs Africa's largest portfolio of youth media brands. One of the brands, StateCraft Inc was official communication agency to the Buhari Presidential Campaign and spent the past six months working to get him elected. Below he details the five things that the president must do now that he's in power. The opinions expressed are solely those of Chude Jideonwo's. (CNN)Disclosure is important: I have been part of a team that worked for the new Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari -- from building the cache of photos that defined his image to getting fliers across the country in all of our languages. I have gone from grudgingly voting for him in 2011 (I made up my mind an hour before voting) to enthusiastically putting relationships and business on the line for what seemed like a quixotic quest. But long after Muhammadu Buhari is President of Nigeria's Federal Republic, I will still be a citizen. And as a citizen, I know, that by this evening, the honeymoon will be over. He knows this more than anyone else, and he certainly doesn't need advice to do what he does best -- work hard, and fast. Still, these would be my suggestions for his top five priorities. Set an example: The cult of personality that led President Buhari to victory was built on a simple premise -- Nigeria, for once, needs a man shorn of greed; who owns less in terms of material, and covets even less. There are those who insist that the fate of a nation cannot lie solely on Buhari's personality, and perhaps they are right. But the 'lau lau' (Nigerian slang for wasteful) lifestyle of the president who is leaving office led to unprecedented waste, and turned corruption into art. Now, because of Buhari's reputation, governments and corporate Nigeria have begun to tighten their belts. Oil marketers are suspended in terror; people even expect the cost of land in Nigeria to drop. If he steps into power, and changes; then nothing he says and nothing he does will matter. It will ruin everything. And what a darn shame that will be. Subsidy has to go There has long been a media and elite consensus that Nigeria's labyrinth of petro-politics -- which swallows at least $4.2 billion yearly in the name of subsidy -- is a scam. Unfortunately, because he lacked both the credibility and the vision to overhaul that system, Nigerians rightly railed against President Goodluck Jonathan when he tried to remove the subsidy in 2012. The argument was simple -- why force us to tighten our belts when you continue to buy new presidential jets? Thankfully, President Buhari has the competence (as former oil minister) and the personal credibility to make that decision now. It will be a bloody billion-dollar fight. But he, frankly, has no choice. #BringBackOurGirls The President-Elect has said he cannot know if the 219 Chibok girls kidnapped by Boko Haram last year will be found, and he is right. Still, Boko Haram has ravaged this country in many ways, but above all it has stolen our faith in government. The girls stand as a symbol of our hopelessness -- that despite a world unified in horror and haste, our government has yet failed. To re-inspire a nation to reconnect with its strength and its will, there is no stronger message than for those girls to be found. Cost of government The cost of running Nigeria is obscene. The federal wage bill, at $9 billion, currently outstrips the expected revenue from crude oil sales and Nigeria's current budget deficit stands at $5 billion, despite more than three years of crude oil prices averaging over $100 a barrel. The salary for 469 federal legislators stands at $750 million. It sounds like a cliche, but it is no less true -- simply cutting the obscene amounts we spend on 'public service' will help Nigeria with more money for the things that truly matter -- regenerating industry, creating jobs, unloading the power sector, social security, saving. Entrepreneurs matter I am an entrepreneur, and I know that it's incredibly hard to be one in this country. There is no access to finance, there's multiple-taxation and a crippling patronage system that relies on endorsements and kickbacks. We lack systems that enable us to truly unlock wealth and sustain growth for entrepreneurs. Nigeria is lucky to have a proven entrepreneurial energy proven in new-industry addition (over $552 billion) to our GDP, and a massive influx of foreign direct investment. It is time for our government to actually connect with the aspiration of an eager youth population that's fired up and ready to go. As we say in Nigeria, time is going.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Boko Haram victim: I'll keep my captor's baby - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>"Um Haleema" was kidnapped by Boko Haram and forced into marriage. She escaped, but returned to her village pregnant and has been stigmatized as a result.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Um Haleema was just 16 years old when she was kidnapped. Her first few months in captivity, at the hands of militant group Boko Haram, were enough to break anyone's spirit -- let alone that of a teenage girl so far from home. She was captured trying to escape, along with three of her friends, as Boko Haram burned and ransacked her village. During her captivity, Um Haleema was forced to watch men, women and children slaughtered. She was forced into marriage. Forced to wait on a "husband" she hated. But while she watched, she says she was also waiting -- for a chance to break free. And after six long months, it finally came. "I had planned my escape from the beginning," she says. "There was a time my husband spent two weeks away, so I attempted to escape but guards returned me and beat me." Eventually, her captors' vigilance began to slip and she managed to escape. In her fear, all she remembers is walking for what felt like days until she finally reached safety. She arrived home to discover that her father had been killed by the same Boko Haram militants who had held her captive for almost a year. She also found she had become pregnant by her Boko Haram husband. Now, seven months along in her pregnancy, she has agreed to speak to CNN on the condition that we conceal her identity and change her name. She doesn't want to become the face of a growing crisis -- girls and women brutally victimized by Boko Haram. The fear, she says, is still with her. This time, though, it's the men in her own community she is scared of. "People in this village are rejecting me because of the pregnancy," she says. "Some will be happy to have me dead. Many people are even saying that I should go for an abortion." It's an option she refuses to contemplate, even though she says local men have let it be known they will not tolerate the children of Boko Haram living amongst them. She says they have threatened to kill both her and her baby. There are no exact figures, but aid agencies and government officials have told CNN that an alarming percentage of girls rescued from Boko Haram have returned pregnant. The UNFPA, which is working in camps for Nigeria's internally displaced, reports that 214 women in the camps are visibly pregnant, but it is still assessing how many got pregnant while being held by Boko Haram, and if there are still more in the earlier stages of pregnancy. "We do not know yet the total number of pregnant girls among those rescued," said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in a report. "The screening is still ongoing." UNFPA said it is working to meet the medical, physical and psychological needs of the freed women. In recent months, Nigeria's military has raided several Boko Haram bases freeing captive women and children. In late April to early May, about 700 women and girls were rescued in separate operations. On hearing that her daughter had been abducted, Um Haleema's mother says she immediately feared the worst. "Anybody captured by Boko Haram is presumed dead," she explains. "They abducted my step-daughter‎ and my daughter. They took a total of seven girls from this house." She says she has heard of many mothers who felt that abortion was the only option they had, but insists it's not a risk she's willing to take with her daughter. "We heard about one girl who died after she attempted an abortion, losing both the mother and the baby," she says. "The girl was the only child to her mother, so that scared us. If God wishes, she will give birth safely. Life is in the hands of God alone." Boko Haram: A bloody insurgency, a growing challenge CNN spoke to the men Um Haleema accused of threatening her in her village. Part of a local vigilante group, they denied making the threats. The vigilante groups in the north of Nigeria -- men who take up arms to protect their communities from Boko Haram -- have long been used by the Nigerian government in an auxiliary capacity to fight against the militants. Their leader agreed to speak CNN. "I am not aware of any woman in this village who was impregnated by them," he said. "If any woman is found to be pregnant, in our tradition, the pregnancy is considered Haram (unlawful), hence we cannot accept them wholeheartedly because they can be like baby snakes." In Muslim communities, pregnancy outside of marriage is often seen as illegitimate, unless the mother can prove it was against her will. When the interview ended and the camera stopped rolling, the vigilante leader said that his group didn't believe Um Haleema had been forced into marriage and said that she and her unborn child will always be viewed with suspicion. But he refused to comment on what he and his men might do about it. Regardless of what others say, surviving both abduction and escape has made Um Haleema realize that she has the strength to see this through. Her child, she says, deserves to live.

            <cabecalho>Do Egypt's empty animal mummies reveal an ancient scam? - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Researchers have scanned hundreds of animal mummies and found a considerable number contain only partial animal remains or are completely empty.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Tens of centuries ago, animals were increasingly seen as sacred representation of gods in ancient Egypt. Pilgrims would often pay for the mummification of an animal, in return for divine favor or revelation. And so a lucrative industry began (made up of animal keepers, embalmers, priests, and laborers building the cemeteries and catacombs) and, over time, up to 70 million animals were carefully preserved -- or so Ancient Egyptians thought. Now, 3,000 years later, researchers in England have uncovered what by modern standards appears to be a scam of epic proportions. Using the latest medical imaging technology, radiographers and Egyptologists have scanned hundreds of animal mummies and found a considerable number contain only partial animal remains or are completely empty. The researchers from Manchester Museum and the University of Manchester used a CT scanner and X-ray machine that would normally be used on children, to see beneath the wrappings without damaging the ancient specimens inside. On their findings, Lidija McKnight, who led the team, says: "We always knew that not all animal mummies contained what we expected them to contain, but we found around a third don't contain any animal material at all -- so no skeletal remains." To explain the phenomenon McKnight told the BBC that even the smallest parts of the animal may have been considered sacred and worth the effort of embalming. "We don't think it's forgery or fakery. It's just that they were using everything they could find."  Indeed the scale of animal mummification was so huge that other experts suggest that the use of fakes would have become inevitable. According to professor Selima Ikram, who in 2011 helped curate an exhibition of animal mummies at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC, baboons were mummified into near extinction. "If you wanted to have a baboon as an offering, you make it look like a baboon -- and if you say it is a baboon, then it magically becomes a baboon. The real ones were very expensive and hard to come by and that's why the whole genre of fake mummies started."  McKnight corroborates this idea that the belief systems of ancient Egyptians made the use of fake mummies acceptable. "Today, we want to think that what we are buying is what we are getting. But the ancient Egyptians were different. They were buying a mummy as a representation of a god. They believed that whatever was inside could be transformed magically." But if the animal mummies do not reveal some ancient hoax, what does the discovery actually tell us? McKnight suggests that the research, (which has been the most comprehensive to date, bringing various museum collections and different types of animals together in one study), holds interesting lessons for those studying climate change in Africa. "There are lessons to be learned about what ancient Egypt was like. From the mummies we can presume that Egypt might have been greener. For example, there would have been water sources that attracted large colonies of the sacred ibis -- one of the most mummified birds," says McKnight. The scared ibis, which represented to ancient Egyptians the god Thoth is extinct in modern Egypt, but still thrives on wetlands in sub-Saharan Africa.

            <corpo>(CNN)It's a shame the Women's World Cup doesn't get the love the men's does. You're so missing out. The women play with a hunger that million-dollar prima donnas (read: Ronaldo) just can't always muster. The games aren't always a foregone conclusion (Long-shots like Australia can surprise you here). And your team can actually win this thing. (We're talking to you, U.S. and England). The tournament began Sunday and runs until July 5. The U.S. takes on Australia at 7:30 p.m. ET Monday. Still not convinced? Let us dispel some more doubts, so you'll give Women's World Cup a shot.  You know how some Americans complain that soccer's boring because there are so few goals? Not here. In the opener yesterday, Norway beat Thailand 4-0. And how many goals did Germany score against the goalless Ivory Coast? TEN! Yes, 10!  You know how in men's soccer, a strong wind is enough to knock a player over. And they play-act like a babies? The women don't have time for that. According to a study, women fake injury half as much as men do. And when they are on the ground rolling around, they're back up 30 seconds faster than men.  You know what the big controversy was, ahead of the 2014 men's World Cup in Brazil? In six of the 12 cities that hosted the games, the quality of the grass was poor and could really injure a player. Oh boo hoo! At least the men had grass. The women will play their games on synthetic turf. Turf burns are brutal. Legs are going to get beat up.  If you're an American, then get behind Team USA. While the men's team has made much progress, the women have won the World Cup not once (1991) but twice (1999) and came so close four years ago. Remember that iconic pic of Brandi Chastain celebrating? That was her after scoring the winning penalty kick against China, when she became every girl's soccer hero. If you're a Brit, your women's team could also make you proud (unlike Rooney and the boys). Plus, they're in a relatively easy group. And if you're German, your guys already won the men's World Cup last year. Why not make it a two-fer? Your gals are ranked #1 in the world.  We'll admit, it's hard to top Luis Suarez chomping down on an opponent. And that's a good thing in the women's game. It keeps the 'beautiful game' beautiful. But women's soccer has its share of drama. Remember this epic hair pull? Or what about when Colombia's Lady Andrade left a shiner on U.S.' Abby Wambach during the London Olympics?  Messi. Tevez. Neymar. You know them all. And you should. They're really, really good. You know who else is good? Abby Wambach. How good? Well, she's scored more goals for a national team than any other player in soccer history. And that includes women and men. Then there's Brazil's Marta, nicknamed "Pele with a skirt." Slightly sexist, we know. But it's meant as a compliment. She was named FIFA Woman's Player of the Year five times. She's yet to win a World Cup and you can bet, she'll be giving it her all.

            <descricao>An Egyptian court sentenced 11 men to death for involvement in deadly Port Said riots in 2012 that left more than 70 dead, according to Egyptian state TV.</descricao>
            <corpo>Cairo (CNN)An Egyptian court sentenced 11 men to death Tuesday for their involvement in the worst soccer violence in Egypt's history, according to a broadcast on Egyptian state TV. More than 70 people, some of them children, were killed on February 1, 2012, when fans rioted at a soccer game in the northeastern city of Port Said. Fans of the hometown Al-Masry club stormed the field after securing a win over Cairo's Al-Ahly club. Horrified witnesses described how police officers stood by and watched as rival fans attacked one another with rocks, knives and swords. The 11 sentenced to death in a retrial of the case were connected to Al-Masry. They will be able to appeal their sentences, state media reported. Forty other people received prison sentences in the case. The morning after the riots, the stadium looked like a scene from a horror film, with blood splattered on seats and walls. Dozens of shoes were left near a gate ripped from its hinges by the pressure of a surging crowd trying to escape. Al-Ahly fans blamed police for what happened. The head of the Port Said security directorate and head of maritime police both received five-year sentences over the deadly violence. After the Port Said incident, Egypt banned soccer fans from games, and teams played in nearly empty stadiums. Authorities later partially lifted the ban by allowing a limited number of fans to attend games, state media reported. Unfortunately, Egypt remains no stranger to soccer violence. Last February, 19 people were killed in a crush involving Zamalek club soccer fans. Authorities blamed the deaths on ticketless fans who tried to push their way in to the game. But Zamalek fans painted a different picture, saying on social media that they were tear gassed as they tried to pass through a single, narrow gated entrance.

            <cabecalho>Peter Greste: How can I appear in Egypt, if banned? - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Peter Greste was deported from Egypt in February and now he and two Al Jazeera colleagues face a retrial there -- but he is still banned from the country.</descricao>
            <corpo>Peter Greste is an Australian-born veteran foreign correspondent. He and fellow Al Jazeera journalists Mohamed Fahmy and Baher Mohamed were arrested in Egypt in December 2013, accused of supporting the banned Muslim Brotherhood. Greste was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment but released and deported in February. A retrial for all three starts this week. The views expressed in this commentary are solely his. (CNN)The Egyptian prosecutor who has brought us before the court in Cairo really isn't so different from the three of us on trial. In essence he, like a journalist, is an investigator trying to get to the truth of the matter, uncovering the facts and relaying them in a coherent narrative so that his audience can understand what is really going on. Both of us have a heavy legal and moral responsibility to get the story right, and for both, the consequences of getting it wrong can be devastating. That's why it was so startling to see the tale he wove at the latest hearing in a Cairo court on Monday. We were originally convicted and sentenced to between seven and 10 years' hard labor in our first trial that was universally condemned as a travesty of justice. The appeals court later described the verdict as "flawed" and "contradictory," overturned the convictions, and ordered a retrial. According to the prosecutor, we doctored footage of unrest in Egypt, and added sound effects to make the country appear as though it was in a state of crisis. The central theme of his story is that we had formed a secret cell, working essentially as propagandists for the Muslim Brotherhood, trying to undermine and destabilize the country. The narrative is largely unchanged from the first trial despite a startling lack of evidence that we had been doing anything criminal, or even unethical. In principle, we needn't be concerned. After all, our work is, by definition, a matter of public record. In this digital age, with countless competing traditional and new media sources, it is almost impossible to get away with making up the news for longer than a few hours, and certainly not with a story as thoroughly covered as the Egyptian political crisis that was unfolding when we were arrested around the end of 2013. Yet nobody other than the prosecutor has seriously challenged the legitimacy of our work. #FreeAJStaff After our first trial and conviction, hundreds of our professional colleagues -- including some of our fiercest rivals -- taped up their lips and held #FreeAJStaff signs in solidarity with our cause. Millions of people around the world joined the social media campaign (The hashtag #FreeAJStaff received almost three billion impressions); and political figures up to and including U.S. President Barack Obama himself spoke out against what was universally regarded as an attack on freedom of the press. It is vital that the court gets it right this time, not only because of the consequences for all those caught up in the case, but for Egypt as a whole, and the wider principles that our case came to represent. That's why I want to do all I can to defend myself and my colleagues, and also help the court get to the truth of the matter. That's not easy though, not least because I am not there. Egypt's president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi deported me in February this year, creating an awkward legal conundrum: how do I obey the judge's demand that I appear in court; without violating the executive order that kicked me out of the country in the first place? Breaking new ground This is not a trivial problem. Under Egypt's rules, if I do not appear I will be formally declared as on trial in absentia, and so be convicted by default, regardless of the evidence -- or in this case the lack of evidence -- against us. As a way of solving that problem, I am offering to appear by video link. There is no indication that the authorities are willing to go with the idea -- it has never been done before in Egypt, so it would mean breaking new ground -- and we have not yet had any formal response. But if the first principle of any legal system is to get to the truth of the matter, then they must surely be willing to consider anything that helps uncover the story about the facts. As any investigator knows, there are two ways of approaching any given situation: either marshal the facts and hope that they point to a particular narrative; or come with a pre-conceived theory, and see if the facts support it. The risk inherent in the second approach is the tendency to choose whatever bits of information seem to confirm the theory, and bin the inconvenient bits that don't. If the court falls into that trap, it will kill the already badly damaged relationship between Egypt's government and the press, and further harm the country's international relationship. And that would be in nobody's interests.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>FIFA and the revenge of the Women's World Cup - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>The next month of Women's World Cup could be an opportunity for FIFA to deflect attention away from its scandal and finally give women's soccer its due.</descricao>
            <corpo>Amy Bass, a professor of history at the College of New Rochelle, has written widely on the cultural history of sports, including the book "Not the Triumph but the Struggle: The 1968 Olympics and the Making of the Black Athlete." She is a veteran of eight Olympics as the supervisor of NBC's Olympic Research Room, for which she won an Emmy in 2012. Follow her on Twitter @bassab1. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)For the past few weeks, soccer has held an unusually prominent place in U.S. headlines, although for scandal rather than action on the pitch. All the talk about bribes and politics and the squalid doings of world soccer's ruling body, FIFA, obscured a happier soccer story: Over the weekend in Canada, the elite women of the world took to the field to start the largest and longest Women's World Cup ever held -- 52 matches among 24 teams. And the American women are, as always, a top contender to take it all. The relative lack of attention paid to the Women's World Cup is no surprise. While it will take some time to see if the resignation of FIFA President Sepp Blatter has any effect on the organization's alleged shenanigans, one thing is sure: His downfall is nothing but good for the women's game. He has never been what one would call supportive. The popularity of women's soccer has grown under his tenure, but not for reasons he ever appeared to understand. "Let the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball," he famously said in 2004. "They could, for example, have tighter shorts." American superstar Alex Morgan says Blatter did not know who she was at the FIFA Player of the Year awards in 2013, where she was being honored as one of the top three in the world. Teammate Abby Wambach led a gender discrimination suit against FIFA over the issue of artificial turf, something Blatter and his cronies basically ignored until the women dropped the suit. Fans of the women's game are hoping that the tournament itself will become the focus in the coming weeks. But the lead-up to the Women's World Cup has always paled in comparison to the frenzy that surrounds the men, a sign of women's lack of status in international sport. Some, however, see the next month as an opportunity for FIFA to deflect attention onto the field. "In a strange way, the scandal can work to the benefit of the WWC," American soccer legend Alexi Lalas, an analyst for Fox Sports' coverage of the tournament, told me. "It is the perfect distraction and shield and it can come to represent the antithesis of the scandal. If I were FIFA, I would be steering and focusing everything and everyone towards the event. No one will forget the events of the last week, but if FIFA does it right, the WWC can at least provide a temporary escape." In a strange twist of events, then, maybe the scandal will finally allow the women to get their due. "FIFA is in the middle of a scandal of its own design, but if there is one thing that was made clear after the so-called turf debate, it's that the women's game is increasingly powerful, with or without FIFA," said Canadian soccer writer Keph Senett. "This popularity and fan loyalty is the fruits of women's labors -- the players -- not the organization. FIFA's comeuppance is just in time. It makes way for the fans to focus on top-notch sport played expertly by passionate professionals." This kind of star power is certainly true of the U.S. squad, which comes into the tournament as reigning Olympic champion. With Morgan and Wambach on the cover of Sports Illustrated, alongside teammates Carli Lloyd and Sydney Leroux, the hopes of the U.S. capturing its first crown since 1999 loom large and very possible. (Let's not talk about that heartrending shootout defeat to Japan four years ago.) The U.S. starts its march toward the July 5 final in Group D, squaring off Monday against Australia in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and then Sweden (June 12, Winnipeg) and Nigeria (June 16, Vancouver, British Columbia). If the team doesn't win its group -- and Australia's Lisa de Vanna and Nigeria's Asisat Oshoala are going to do their best to prevent it -- the road to an unprecedented third title will be more difficult, with powerful opponents such as Brazil and Japan waiting in the wings, and two-time champ Germany, ranked No. 1, looming ever larger, having crushed Ivory Coast in its opening match Sunday, a brutal 10-0. The Americans have their work cut out for them. While 15 members of the squad are World Cup vets, many of the stars, including Wambach and Morgan, have been fighting injuries of late. But there is hope that newbies such as Leroux, a power forward who has averaged the most goals in the fewest minutes of any U.S. women's national team member ever, will rise to the challenge. Last summer, Americans finally appeared to have caught World Cup fever: ESPN saw record-breaking numbers of viewers for U.S. games -- some 24.7 million watched the U.S. men's team square off against Portugal -- and fans found a legitimate rock star in goalie Tim Howard. While Fox Sports has seen heavy demand for advertising space, the women's tournament still poses the intriguing question: Will a chance for international glory be enough to get people to watch the women?

            <corpo>Kano, Nigeria (CNN)Suicide bombers detonated an explosion that tore through a marketplace Friday in eastern Nigeria, killing at least 31 people and injuring dozens of others, Adamawa State Police Spokesman Othman Abubakar said. The blast happened in the town of Yola, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of the border with Cameroon, said Sa'ad Bello, the coordinator for the country's National Emergency Management Agency in Adamawa state. Thirty-eight people were sent to a hospital with injuries; others with minor injuries were treated and discharged at the scene, Bello said. The attackers caused maximum damage by pretending to be in a fight with each other outside the marketplace before detonating their explosives, Abubakar said. "The scene naturally attracted people around who gathered around the two men to find out what the problem was and possibly settle whatever dispute led to the fight," Abubakr said, "As soon as the crowd gathered the two men detonated their explosives, killing a considerable number and injuring many." Journalist Aminu Abubakar reported from Kano, and CNN's Jason Hanna wrote in Atlanta. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Mozambique by Mini Cooper: Small car, big adventure - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Overlanding in Africa doesn't always require a 4x4. Smoother roads mean a regular set of wheels are just as good.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)When most people think of overlanding in Africa, they think of organized tours in big trucks or 4x4s with roof tents, fridges and boxes full of tools. It's true that there are many parts of Africa where you need a fairly sturdy vehicle to traverse potholed blacktop or kilometers of dirt roads. But much of southern Africa is traveled in an ordinary sedan with no more specialized driving knowledge than the abilities to read a map and change a flat tire. Mozambique is an amazing country for a road trip, especially for anyone looking for beaches. It has a good tarred road -- the EN1 -- that hugs the Indian Ocean coastline. The EN1 can be easily driven. It reaches all the way from the South African border to Vilanculos, 700 kilometers up the coast -- the gateway to the famed Bazaruto Archipelago, a group of five idyllic islands some 30 kilometers offshore. The route calls in first to the city of Maputo, and then through beautiful landscapes, past turquoise lagoons, seas of palm trees, giant gnarled baobabs and clouds of butterflies. I choose a Mini Cooper for my trip, which attracts waves and smiles. The real highlights don't come until the Mini turns off the EN1 and drives the smaller roads that lead to Mozambique's spectacular beaches. The beaches range from near-deserted stretches of dune-fringed sand to traveler-friendly seaside resorts complete with surf schools and yoga retreats. Convertible Minis can be rented from DriveSouthAfrica.co.za. Drivers can take a rental car across the South African border into Mozambique, but need to let the rental car company know so it can provide a letter of permission for the border crossing. Note: Many of Mozambique's off-the-beaten track beaches are accessible only with a 4x4 vehicle, but with forward planning, pick-ups can be arranged with hotels. Tip: It's advisable to stick to the speed limit when driving in Mozambique -- the EN1 is well patrolled by traffic police waiting to dole out hefty fines even for minor breaches of the speed limit, which range between 60 and 120 kilometers per hour.  Only 120 kilometers from the South African border, Mozambique's coastal capital feels like a different world. An intriguing mix of Europe and Africa, Maputo is home to crumbling colonial buildings, lively markets, wide avenues named after communist leaders, art deco apartments the colors of fruit sorbets and a vibrant live music scene. It has eclectic architecture, including the century-old elegant CFM Train Station, which made an appearance in the movie "Blood Diamond" and is home to Kampfumo (+258 82 986 0137), Maputo's most unusual bar, sandwiched between two platforms. There's also the Casa de Ferro, a bizarre-looking metal house designed by Gustav Eiffel. Visitors can catch bands performing at the Franco-Mozambican Cultural Centre, while away afternoons drinking South African wines and eating Greek food on Dhow Cafe's couches (Rua de Marracuene No.4, Maputo; +258 21 492115), which overlook a bay crisscrossed with dhows. Mozambique's Portuguese-influenced cuisine is available at Manjar dos Deuses (Avenue Julius Nyerere, Maputo). Undoubtedly the best place to stay in the city, the Polana Serena (1380 Av. Julius Nyerere, Maputo; +258 21 241 700) is one of Africa's most famous grande dame hotels. The hotel, which dates to 1922, is elegant and atmospheric, with a marble lobby and antique elevator, expansive verandas, a massive swimming pool and lavishly decorated sea-facing rooms.  Just more than an hour's drive north of the popular beach resort of Xai-Xai (pronounced "shy shy"), Chidenguele, a tiny blip on the map, is largely overlooked by travelers, which means it's quiet. Naara Eco-Lodge and Spa (+258 84 321 2209) is the best pick of accommodation options. If arranged ahead, cars can be left in the village and a ride hitched on a 4x4 up a hilly, sandy road to the lodge. This is a collection of 10 safari tents with outdoor showers surrounded by bush overlooking the calm water of Nhambavale Lake. It's a bit of a walk to the beach, but anyone who makes it will have a vast stretch of sand virtually to themselves. The lodge organizes fishing, kayaking, wind surfing, birding and community walks, but it's also acceptable to do next to nothing.  A longtime backpacker favorite, the small village of Tofo, with its enticing stretch of golden sand beach, now also caters to a more upmarket crowd, with a crop of luxurious beach houses for rent and boutique hotels. There's plenty to fill up the days, from surfing lessons (Tofo beach is a great spot for beginners while nearby Tofinho, with its reef break, draws more intermediate surfers), kite surfing, kayaking, yoga lessons and horseback riding, as well as diving and snorkeling. There are occasional chances to swim with whale sharks, humpback whales and manta rays.   Tofo has a selection of good eating options: thin-crust pizza and prawns cooked over lava hot stones at Branko's (Tofo Beach; +258 84 066 6470) or fresh seafood and traditional Mozambican dishes such as crab matapa (a stew made from cassava leaves, ground peanuts and coconut milk) at Tofo Tofo. Stylish sea-view bungalows at the Baia Sonambula Guest House (Tofo Beach; +258 29 329 032), only 50 meters from the beach, include a beautiful little garden and delicious breakfasts.  Vilanculos is a busy, dusty town that's worth escaping almost immediately on arrival. Cars can be dropped off at the airport and a pick-up arranged from the owners of Marimba Secret Gardens (Vilanculos; +258 84 686 4373). They'll drive guests in a 4x4 on a thick, sandy road to reach their laid-back retreat, 23 kilometers north of town. Simple huts made from wood, reeds and thatch are set on stilts and surrounded by gardens and thick bush, a short walk from a beautiful beach shared with only a few local fishermen. Guest can hang out in hammocks, do a guided walk through the neighboring community of Chipongo (a chance to see what Mozambican rural village life is like) or go on snorkeling trips to the islands of the Bazaruto Archipelago. At night, meals are served outside under the stars and often feature the catch of the day with coconut rice.  While day trips to the archipelago from Marimba Secret Gardens are great, the Bazaruto islands offer overnight accommodation. There are only a handful of resorts to choose from, all of which will organize boat pick-ups from the mainland. Azura (+27 11 467 0907) on Benguerra Island offers 17 "barefoot-luxury" villas on the beach. These are equipped with their own plunge pools and beach huts. There's also horseback riding on beaches, deep sea fishing and diving among shoals of technicolor fish on one of the coral reefs.  Sarah Duff is a South African freelance travel writer and photographer who's been published in newspapers and magazines around the world.

            <cabecalho>Congo: painting colonial brutality in the DRC  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Congo's turbulent history is documented in a new art exhibition.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)In front of a white building, with a Belgian flag flying high in the yard, a black man in a striped t-shirt and shorts is being strangled with a chain. Nearby, another black man is lying face down on the ground, his trousers pulled down to reveal deep bleeding cuts in his buttocks. Above him stands another black man, smartly dressed in a colonial police officer's uniform, whip raised above his head, ready to strike. The guard looks furtively over at a white man, in a white uniform with the Belgian flag sewn into his lapel, and a white pith helmet on his head. He smokes a pipe and has one hand in his pocket. His other hand casually directs the violence in the yard. This scene is from one of the paintings in a new exhibition, 53 Echoes of Zaire, which opens on 27 May at the Sulger-Buel-Lovell gallery in London. The painting, titled "Congo Belge II," was made in the 1970s and depicts a period in the history of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (previously know as Zaire), a former Belgian colony. The Kingdom of Kongo rose in the 1300s, and part of it became Congo Free State, the private holding of Belgian King Leopold II, in the 1880s. Speaking of that colonial history, Christian Sulger-Buel, who co-founded the gallery says: "Belgian Congo is an extraordinary exception to the colonial norm. It was dramatically exploited by one man, King Leopold (II), who treated the people and the land like his private property. He owned Congo the way you'd own your car."  The artist, T. Kalema, was part of a group that came to be known as the "Lubumbashi Movement," artists living and working in the southeastern city of Lubumbashi. The work of the Lubumbashi Movement served as a way to document Congo's turbulent history. The political nature of the art created in Lubumbashi in the 1970s is particular to the city, which is the copper mining heartland of Congo. "In Kinshasa (the capital of the DRC) the subjects of art were typically social, lighter and with a lot of humor," says Salimata Diop, head of programs at London's Africa Centre, and the exhibition's curator. By contrast, artists who were part of the Lubumbashi Movement painted scenes from the slave trade in the 16th and 17th centuries, through to the brutality by the colonial masters and right up to their contemporary struggles: miners strikes, independence, the secession of Katanga, and hope in Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba that turns to despair as he's arrested and later killed. "These artists were not making 'airport art' -- art for foreigners or tourists to buy," says Diop. "They saw themselves as artisans and were making art for local people." Among these visual historians in Lubumbashi a sub-genre called "Colonie Belge" became popular. "These paintings typically depict a white man -- the colonial master -- impeccably dressed, doing nothing except watching a black man flog another black man, often while his family look on," explains Sulger-Buel. The images are striking not just for their graphic content but also for their use of color, a remarkable achievement considering the poverty in which the artists lived. "They had access to only basic primary colors and despite the fine lines in some of the paintings, only worked with large brushes," says Sulger-Buel.  Tshibumba Kanda-Matulu, the lead artist in the exhibition with over 30 works, had aspirations to be a teacher but became an artist. He was already prolific when he met Etienne Bol, a Belgian man his age with whom he struck up a friendship. Between 1971 and 73, Bol commissioned Kanda-Matulu and four other artists to paint the images displayed in the exhibition. Diop says: "Paintings (usually created on canvasses made from flour sacks) sold for very modest sums. Kanda-Matulu lived in a small one bedroom house and found it difficult to make a living from his art. He was very poor." Despite his contribution to popular Congolese art, Kanda-Matulu's life is shrouded in mystery. He met Etienne Bol in 1972, 10 years later, in 1982, he disappeared. People he knew thought he had gone back to his village, others speculated that he may have moved to neighboring Zambia. Given the political nature of his art, could his disappearance have been politically motivated? Diop doesn't think so but says: "Tshibumba was easy to find -- he was always working from home. But suddenly, he wasn't there anymore. In the troubled times (under the autocrat Mobutu Sese Seko) it was not uncommon for people to move a lot in search of a peaceful life. We don't know if he's alive or dead." The exhibition, which closes on June 30, the day Congo gained independence from Belgium 55 years ago, is overall a portrayal of what Sulger-Buel calls "the demons of Africa -- forced labor, civil war, violent repression of student protests," which still haunt Congo today. Whether seen as a retelling of the past or a perspective on its present day, the art and artists of the Lubumbashi Movement deserve a place in Congo's national history and on the global art scene.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Police thwarted an attack at the Karnak Temple in Luxor, Egypt, on Wednesday, killing two of three armed assailants, the country's Interior Ministry said.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Two assailants were killed and one injured in a thwarted attack at Karnak Temple in Luxor, Egypt, on Wednesday morning, authorities said. The attackers confronted security officials at Karnak with firearms and explosives, Egypt's Interior Ministry said in a statement. The three men, who were in a car, tried to enter the temple's parking lot when a plainclothes policeman forced it to stop, Egypt's Tourism Ministry said. Security forces confronted them, and two were killed: one died when he detonated the explosives he was carrying, and another was shot in the head, the Interior Ministry added. The third militant was injured. Egypt's Health Ministry said in a statement that five people were injured, including civilians. "The policeman who stopped the vehicle sustained minor injuries, but due to his heroic actions, many other potential victims were saved and thankfully no tourists were harmed," Tourism Minister Khaled Rami said. Typically, thousands of tourists visit Luxor and Karnak Temple daily. After the attack, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi ordered an intensified security presence at vital sites in the country, including sites of antiquity, el-Sisi's office told CNN. Egypt's minister of antiquity and minister of tourism were in Luxor on Wednesday to assess the situation. This is the first deadly attack on a Luxor tourist site since 1997, when gunmen killed 62 people -- most of them international tourists.  The recent targeting of tourist sites represents a major escalation by Islamist militants in Egypt. Last week, gunmen shot and killed two police officers in an attack a few hundred meters from the Great Pyramids of Giza, the Interior Ministry said. Previously, militants, including the ISIS-aligned Ansar Beit Al Maqdis, mostly targeted Egyptian government officials and security forces. But four people were killed and 14 wounded when Ansar Beit Al Maqdis targeted a bus of South Korean tourists traveling from Egypt's Sinai Peninsula into Israel in February 2014. Militants have killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers since the overthrow of Islamist President Mohamed Morsy in July 2013. Recently, they expanded their targets to include judges. Wednesday's attack coincided with the signing of the African Tripartite Free Trade Agreement in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. Several African leaders, including el-Sisi, are attending the summit in the Sinai Peninsula, hundreds of kilometers away from the site of Wednesday's attack. In a post last month on its official Arabic website, the Muslim Brotherhood appeared to endorse a call to arms by urging followers to "resist this coup by all means until the fall of the regime" and asserted the "legitimate right to self-defense." Security forces have arrested anyone belonging to or accused of working with the Brotherhood, a group designated by Egypt as a terrorist organization. Hundreds of Islamists and their supporters have been killed in the crackdown.  The Egyptian government has been trying to lure back tourists for the summer high season. Tourism represents 11.3% of Egypt's gross domestic product and 19.3% of its foreign currency revenues, Egypt's State Information Services says. "The government of Egypt places the highest priority on the safety of tourists in our country," said Rami, the tourism minister. "We have enhanced security measures in place at all our sites, and we continue to take every possible measure to ensure that no harm comes to anyone visiting Egypt."  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>10 budget airlines changing Africa's skies - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Traveling across Africa's huge distances used to be expensive and involve tedious connections through Europe. That's finally changing.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Traveling across Africa's huge distances can be expensive. Not that long ago, getting from one city to another often meant a connection in Europe. That's finally changing. Low-cost airlines are taking off across the region, serving routes that cater to the continent's growing middle class. It hasn't been easy for them. African nations signed an "open skies" agreement in 1988, similar to the one in Europe that cleared the way for successes like easyJet. Most countries have yet to actually implement the agreement. But as the number of potential travelers grows, the new low-cost airlines are slowly convincing governments about the benefits of increased air travel. "There are more than one billion people on the African continent, which is home to just 3% of the world's aviation business," says Ed Winter, CEO of Tanzania-based fastjet. "It is clear that the continent remains in desperate need of improved and affordable aviation connectivity." There's a long list of failed ventures -- Velvet Sky and 1time in South Africa both went bust in 2012. Fly540 scrapped its flights to Accra and Luanda last year. But that's not deterring new operators. 1time hopes to reboot itself this year. Nigeria's Arik Air is looking into creating a low-cost carrier. Blue Crane, an aviation consulting firm in South Africa, hopes to start flying commercial passengers later this year, too. Here are 10 airlines already pushing Africa's travel revolution:  Kulula.com took off in 2001 as Africa's first low-cost carrier. It's still one of the most successful, and the funniest. On its trademark green planes, flight attendants wisecrack through safety announcements, and they've been known to quiz passengers who don't pay attention. But the airline is serious business too. It's operated by South Africa's Comair, the local partner of British Airways. Kulula has also forged deals with Air France and Kenya Airways that have it spread to five other countries. Cities served: Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Bloemfontein, East London, Windhoek, Harare, Mauritius, Victoria Falls, Livingstone, Nairobi  One of the most ambitious of the new carriers, fastjet took off in 2011 running domestic routes in Tanzania. Over the last two years it's expanded to four other countries. The airline has big experience and big backing. Its boss Ed Winter is a former executive at easyJet, which has a stake in the African venture. The airline has set its sights on cracking the lucrative South African domestic market, while also negotiating new routes across the region. Cities served: Dar es Salaam, Johannesburg, Entebbe, Harare, Kilimanjaro, Lusaka, Mbeya, Mwanza  More than any other airline, flyafrica.com has stepped into the void left by the shrunken Air Zimbabwe. With Johannesburg as its hub, flights started last year with jaw-dropping specials like 99-rand ($9) trips to Victoria Falls. In addition to that popular run, it also flies the normally pricey route to Harare -- to the relief of the hundreds of thousands of Zimbabweans living in South Africa. But those cheap tickets don't include any checked bags. Cities served: Johannesburg, Harare, Victoria Falls and Windhoek  Its distinctive orange planes fly mostly within South Africa, plus the holiday spice island Zanzibar. Mango is known for flash sales, with big rebates for fliers who join its mailing list and are willing to book instantly. Cities served: Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban, Port Elizabeth, Bloemfontein, George, Zanzibar  One of the newest competitors within South Africa, FlySafair took off in October and has been trying to build a customer base over established rivals Kulula and Mango. It made a big show of lowering its ticket prices this year to reflect cheaper fuel costs. The tickets are already stripped down -- they don't include checked bags. Cities served: Johannesburg, Cape Town, Port Elizabeth, George  Here's an airline that shows both the incredible possibilities and the challenges of setting up new routes across Africa. Fly540 has enjoyed success in Kenya, where its flights connect even the desert outpost of Lodwar to the rest of the country. But it had to scrap operations in Ghana and Angola in 2014. Now it focuses on Kenya and neighboring countries. Cities served: Nairobi, Eldoret, Mombasa, Kisumu, Lamu, Lodwar, Malindi, Juba, Zanzibar  The budget airline was launched in 2014 by Kenya Airways and only serves four cities, but aviation authorities have cleared the way for JamboJet to operate flights across Africa from Nairobi and Mombasa. Cities served: Nairobi, Eldoret, Mombasa, Kisumu  Once a troubled name in African aviation, this carrier was shut down over the 2012 crash that killed 153 people in Lagos. Dana Air resumed flying a year ago and says all safety concerns have been addressed. It's still working on getting certified by the international aviation authority IATA, but has resumed domestic routes. Cities served: Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Uyo  Although clearly not based in Africa, the airline connects 12 cities on the continent, if passengers don't mind a layover in Dubai. FlyDubai added six cities in 2014, and this year was inaugurating a new flight to Hargeisa in Somaliland. Cities served: Addis Ababa, Alexandria, Bujumbura, Dar es Salaam, Djibouti, Entebbe, Juba, Khartoum, Kigali, Kilimanjaro, Port Sudan, Zanzibar  This new carrier has just started selling tickets for its maiden flight between Johannesburg and Cape Town, scheduled for March 5. The airline is a reboot for the shuttered 1time, whose top executives are behind the new venture. Among their bragging rights: no charges for checked luggage. Cities served: Johannesburg, Cape Town.

            <corpo>(CNN)An explosion that sent flames raging in Ghana's capital, killing 150 people, hit a gas station crowded with residents seeking shelter from heavy rains. The death toll from the Wednesday night blast in Accra is expected to go up, President John Mahama said Friday. The explosion occurred as hundreds huddled under the cover of the gas station and nearby shops to stay dry. A leak at the station sparked the explosion, which spread to a pharmacy and other nearby businesses, Mahama said in a statement. Victims included drivers of public transportation and their passengers, who were waiting out the rain away from open bus terminals, authorities said. Others were motorists who had stopped to refuel, said Ebenezer Ampaabeng from Ghana Broadcasting Corp. Some residents survived the fire, only to be swept away by the gushing waters. "The loss of life is catastrophic, almost unprecedented," Mahama said. Hours after the explosion, charred cars lay scattered across the gas station, some buried under collapsed roofs. Some local communities lost power as authorities urged residents to stay on higher ground to avoid more casualties. Floodwater also affected some roads, making it hard for emergency vehicles to reach those seeking help, authorities said. Mahama declared three days of mourning starting Monday. Flags will fly at half-staff during that period. Heavy rains have pounded Ghana for the past several days. "Ground saturation caused by the heavy downpour of the last three days, together with human activity such as unbridled littering and building in waterways, has resulted in impeding the flow of these rivers and streams into the sea," the President said. There's "unprecedented flooding" in several parts of Accra, he said. CNN's Nana Karikari-apau contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Lost comet lander Philae sends 'hello' from space - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Philae is alive! The lost comet lander from the Rosetta spacecraft signals ESA's operations center in Germany.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's alive! Many moons ago, a small space probe named Philae skipped across the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko when the lander's harpoon-like anchoring mechanism failed. It came to rest in a shady spot and, without enough sunlight to keep it powered, it fell asleep after about 60 hours of operation. Mission scientists had been trying to pinpoint its location since November -- until late Saturday. At 10:28 p.m., the European Space Agency's operations center in Darmstadt, Germany, just south of Frankfurt, received a signal from Philae, which transmitted more than 300 data packets. Those have been analyzed at the Lander Control Center at the German Aerospace Center, which dubbed Philae's emergence from its seven-month slumber a "'hello' from space." "Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35ºC and has 24 watts available," Philae project manager Stephan Ulamec said in a statement. "The lander is ready for operations." To hear Twitter tell it, Philae's comet-chasing mothership, Rosetta, was delighted to hear from the little lander but reluctant to let it delve back into work too hastily after its long sleep. Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter "Hello @ESA_Rosetta! I'm awake! How long have I been asleep? #Lifeonacomet," came the tweet from Philae's handle. "Hello @Philae2014! You've had a long sleep, about 7 months!" Rosetta responded. "Wow @ESA_Rosetta! That's a long time... time for me to get back to work! #Lifeonacomet" "@Philae2014 Need to check you're fit, healthy and warm enough first @philae2014! Take it easy for now :)" "Oh, OK @ESA_Rosetta! I'm still a bit tired anyway... talk to you later! Back to #lifeonacomet!" Months after Philae nodded off, lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needed almost 6 watts of power to reboot itself, 9 watts to accept communications and 19 watts to allow two-way communication with the orbiter -- not a great deal of power when you consider energy-saving lightbulbs use 20 watts or fewer. There was speculation in March that Philae could be awake but lacking the necessary power to communicate with Rosetta, which was in orbit around Comet 67P looking for the washing machine-sized lander. Scientists sent "blind commands" in hopes that the lander could process the instructions even if it couldn't respond, O'Rourke told CNN in March. But there was not immense confidence that Philae could be revived. Asked his thoughts Sunday, O'Rourke told CNN he was "thrilled" contact was re-established, which "allows us to do more science." "We are all delighted -- delighted that Philae survived the long winter. It's a great opportunity," he said. When the lander snapped its hibernation spell Saturday, it "spoke" with the scientists on the ground for 85 seconds, ESA said. "We have also received historical data -- so far, however, the lander had not been able to contact us earlier," Ulamec said, explaining that Philae must have been awake before Saturday night. Scientists eagerly anticipate Philae's next contact, as the lander's memory still contains more than 8,000 data packets that will tell them what has happened in recent days on Comet 67P. Since March 12, Rosetta has been listening for the lander to determine if it had survived the cold, dark recesses of the comet. Scientists promised that if enough sunlight could fall on Philae's solar panels, it could be revived. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. The mishap, said scientists, could prove to be a happy accident. Had Philae touched down in its original landing spot, O'Rourke explained, the temperatures as the comet neared the sun could have burned out the lander's electronics, killing it altogether. But because it found shade -- beneath a cliff face, scientists deduced from images sent by the lander -- it was able to survive. Now, scientists are excited at the prospect of Philae witnessing a remarkable show as 67P makes its closest approach to the sun in August. "I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point," O'Rourke has said. ESA has led the consortium, which includes NASA, to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun. The mission is already changing perceptions of comets. Instead of thinking of a comet as a dirty snowball, O'Rourke has said, he now thinks of a comet as an "icy dirtball." He also described discoveries of dust and large "boulders" circling the comet after they were blown off by the sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football field that has been lifted and deposited next to the hole. "The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery," he said. CNN Interactive: Rosetta and its mission Opinion: How comet mission helps search for alien life  </corpo>

            <corpo>Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)Six top executives in Nigeria's Central Bank are facing charges following the alleged theft of the equivalent of more than $40 million. The suspects are accused of replacing Nigeria's old, defaced and mutilated naira notes, meant for destruction, with newspaper cut into the shape of the naira notes. The newspaper was then destroyed and the old currency recycled back into the economy, according to Nigeria's Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. Sixteen other commercial bankers have also been arrested and charged with conspiracy. "They literally allowed greed and craze for materialism to becloud their sense of judgement and responsibility," reads a statement from the EFCC. The process of destroying counted and audited "dirty" currency is known as briquetting. The crime was only discovered when a member of the briquetting team in the Oshogbo branch, in southwest Nigeria, opened one of the cardboard boxes meant for destruction and found it filled, not with naira, but with newspaper. The bank issued a statement describing how bank staffers discovered the alleged scheme. "As soon as the bank's internal investigations concluded beyond reasonable doubt that some wrongdoing had occurred, the affected members of staff who are middle-level officers were, depending on gravity of offence, either summarily dismissed or immediately placed on indefinite suspension on October 21, 2014, and all handed over to the EFCC for further investigation and prosecution," said the statement from CBN's director of corporate communications, Ibrahim Mu'azu. The EFCC said the scam has gone on for years. "The fraud is partly to blame for the failure of government monetary policy over the years as currency mop up exercises by the apex (Central) bank failed to check the inflationary pressure on the economy," the EFCC said in a statement. If true, it's a crime in which no one was hurt, but the whole country paid. Journalist Aminu Abubakar contributed to this report. </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)A Moroccan magazine has withdrawn its latest edition from the shelves after controversy over a front cover that showed two men at a swimming pool gazing into each other's eyes with the headline, "Should homosexuals be burned?" A statement released by the magazine, Maroc Hebdo (Morocco Weekly), on Friday said its decision to pull the edition -- in paper form and online -- followed "strong reactions" to it, particularly on social media. The statement, issued in the name of editor Mohamed Selhami, also apologized to anyone shocked by the subject matter. "Our publication is not a political editorial that pushes a certain sensationalism or provocative topics that can offend the public," it said. "In this instance, it wanted to show the different sides of a social fact; homosexuality and by extension its status in our society. A debate on today's agenda. Maroc Hebdo wanted in this respect to give an account of this debate." At the same time it announced the edition's withdrawal, the magazine offered "an apology to all readers who could be shocked by this topic and reminds them that it will continue working on opening up a national debate on democracy in our society and the values on which it was founded." Homosexuality is illegal the majority Muslim, North African nation. According to rights group Human Rights Watch, those convicted of homosexual acts under Moroccan law can be sentenced to up to three years in prison and a fine.

            <corpo>(CNN)Guatemala's President will be investigated in a corruption probe and could be stripped of immunity that protects him from prosecution. The Central American nation's Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that President Otto Perez Molina should be investigated and asked the country's lawmakers to lift the President's immunity. The Supreme Court's ruling comes more than a month after Guatemalan Vice President Roxana Baldetti stepped down amid a customs corruption scandal. The Guatemalan Congress will name a commission that will conduct the investigation into Perez Molina, which was requested by an opposition party. A spokesman for Perez Molina said the President would respect the law as the investigation moves forward, the state-run AGN news agency reported. Perez Molina, a retired military general who campaigned on promises to use an "iron fist" to fight crime, won the presidential election in 2011. In recent months, he's faced mounting criticism at home as his Cabinet faces a slew of corruption scandals.

            <corpo>(CNN)Ten years after Natalee Holloway went missing, a Dutch citizen says he knows where to find her. Prosecutors, however, aren't buying it. Jurriën de Jong told CNN's Martin Savidge that the teen's body is buried in a crawl space at a Marriott vacation property in Aruba, and he believes he saw her in her final moments. De Jong says he was near Marriott's Aruba Surf Club, then under construction, on the night of May 30, 2005, when he saw a young man chase a young woman through the construction site. At first, he thought the two were being playful, but he says a short time later the man reappeared, carrying the woman in his arms. He says her body appeared limp. "... He pulled (the woman) by the ankles inside the crawl space, stayed inside for a minute and then came out and closed the gap," de Jong said. Even though de Jong suspected he had witnessed something serious, he says didn't go to the police because he was involved in "illegal activities" at the time.  When news of Holloway's disappearance came out, de Jong put the pieces together, but for three years he says he stayed quiet, afraid he'd be indicted for his own crimes. He also says he was afraid of talking to police and facing retaliation from the people he worked for in his illegal activities, which he declined to specify. De Jong says he had a change of heart after seeing a 2008 Dutch broadcast of an undercover interview with Joran van der Sloot, who was brought in for questioning in Holloway's disappearance but never charged. In that interview, van der Sloot said that Holloway died while the two were together and her body was dumped in the ocean. De Jong says he got angry because he knew it was a lie and says he felt bad because he has a daughter close to Holloway's age. Van der Sloot later said he was lying in that interview. De Jong then called Holloway's father, Dave Holloway, who has never given up hope of finding his daughter. Holloway had faced many false leads and hoaxes before and wrote de Jong off. Holloway's father opens up about new lead  "I was running out of possibilities," de Jong said. "I tried to convince the head prosecutor, the parents, then I tried to convince the other head prosecutor, but he didn't listen." That's when de Jong attempted what he called "Mission Impossible." The site where de Jong says Holloway is buried now rests under the high-rise Marriott Aruba Surf Club resort, in an area called the Spyglass Tower. De Jong bought an electric drill with a diamond tip and went to Aruba to investigate the site. He says he carefully planned a scheme to drill a hole through the hotel floor, but his efforts to take a look in the tower's foundations ultimately failed. Next, de Jong turned to local newspapers. But before long, the new lead hit a snag -- on the night Holloway disappeared, officials say construction of the Spyglass Tower hadn't started. Aruba's chief prosecutor, Eric Olthof, says he spent weeks investigating de Jong's assertions, including a 2010 sworn statement to police. When asked about what construction was underway on May 30, 2005, Olthof says Marriott officials said there was no construction at the spot de Jong pointed out. "It's evident now the story of Mr. de Jong can't be true, so that's a closed book," Oltholf told CNN.  On the other hand, some signs complicate Marriott's official time line of the construction of Spyglass Tower. A satellite image from Google Earth taken in June 2005, just a few weeks after Natalee Holloway disappeared, shows what appears to be the blurry outlines of structures that could resemble a construction site. Holloway's father says he remembers the site from the day after his daughter's disappearance. "I can tell you for a fact. I was there on June 1, and there was definitely construction in that area," he says. Holloway says he has information that construction began in February, but he was not clear on how he knows. Natalee Holloway was last seen on May 30, 2005. CNN's Savidge received this statement from Jeff Flaherty of global corporate relations at Marriott International Inc.: "Mr. de Jong has contacted Marriott in the past and each time we have suggested to Mr. de Jong that he present his account of the matter to the authorities. As we have done all along, we cooperate fully with the authorities whenever they are conducting an official investigation." For his part, de Jong says he believes authorities are dragging their feet. "It's the inconvenient truth. It would damage the image of Aruba as one happy island," he says. Oltholf won't say that de Jong is lying, but says his statement can't be true. "It's the statement of the management of the Marriott that at that time, at that place, there was no construction. When there's no construction, Natalee Holloway can't be buried in the crawl space under the foundation," he said. And, he added, that Marriott has provided proof. "I think they're not wrong because they can prove it with some photographs and some other material. And I think they are right with what they are saying. And Mr. de Jong can't prove it," said Olthof.  Holloway was on a high school graduation trip when she vanished. The 18-year-old from Alabama was last seen leaving a bar with three young men, two brothers and van der Sloot, then 17. Van der Sloot has never been charged in Holloway's disappearance. He says he was with Holloway that night, but left her on the beach, alone. In 2012, he pleaded guilty to the 2010 murder of Stephany Flores in Peru. Flores was killed five years to the day Holloway disappeared. Van der Sloot is serving a 28-year prison sentence. He is expected to be extradited to the United States after his release. What does he think about de Jong's claim that he saw him that night, in 2005? Through his attorney, van der Sloot did not call de Jong a liar, but told CNN's Savidge he was a drug dealer and is only out for money. De Jong denies he ever asked for money, and laughs off the accusation, saying van der Sloot's angry because he's scared. "I think he's desperate. I mean the only reason why he does that is that he's afraid that people go to believe me, " he said. In the United States, he's been indicted on federal charges of extortion and wire fraud. American authorities accuse him of extorting money from Holloway's mother by offering bogus information about her daughter's disappearance. CNN's Martin Savidge and Tristan Smith interviewed Jurriën de Jong in Amsterdam, Netherlands. They've also been in Aruba to examine his allegations further. </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Hurricane Blanca is churning in the Pacific toward Mexico's Baja California coast, where it is expected to make landfall. Blanca has maximum sustained winds of 175 kilometers per hour (110 mph). "The center of Blanca will approach the southwest coast of the Baja California peninsula later today and move near or along the coast tonight and Monday," the National Hurricane Center said Sunday. Mexico issued a tropical storm warning from Puerto San Andresito to Punta Abreojos. By early Sunday, Blanca was about 355 kilometers (220 miles) southwest of Cabo San Lucas, where a hurricane watch is in effect. "Maximum sustained winds have decreased ... with higher gusts," the hurricane Center said. "Additional weakening is forecast during the next 48 hours, and Blanca is expected to weaken to a tropical storm tonight before it reaches the southwestern coast of the Baja California peninsula." Blanca is forecast to be downgraded to a tropical depression Monday night.  </corpo>

            <cabecalho>Officials respond to Haiti Red Cross scandal - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>The American Red Cross disputes a ProPublica and NPR account that the agency received $488 million in donations for Haiti relief but built only six homes.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)The American Red Cross is disputing a news account that alleged serious shortcomings in the relief agency's aid to Haiti after the catastrophic 2010 earthquake, including how the group received $488 million in donations but built only six permanent homes. The Red Cross called the report by ProPublica and National Public Radio as lacking in "balance, context and accuracy ... which follows the pattern of all their previous Red Cross stories." "It is particularly disappointing to see our work misrepresented, considering we answered more than 100 questions in writing and provided an interview with the head of our international programs," a Red Cross statement said.  The investigative account asserted that the Red Cross faced "constant upheaval" of staff in Haiti, a "pattern" of "botched delivery of aid" and "an overreliance on foreigners who could not speak French or Creole." The Red Cross also lacked expertise to carry out its own projects in Haiti and instead gave donors' money to other groups to do the work, escalating costs of overhead and management, which in one case added up to a third of a project's budget, the news outlets said in their account published Wednesday. The outlets also cited a 2013 U.S. Government Accountability Office report that found a Red Cross-USAID partnership to build homes didn't develop "because of the delays in securing land title and because of turnover in Red Cross leadership that resulted in shifting approaches to housing in Haiti," the GAO study said. The U.S. Agency for International Development fights global poverty and promotes democracy. The Red Cross, however, said its overall programs provided clean water and sanitation in Haiti and moved "more than 100,000 people out of makeshift tents into safe and improved housing." "Despite the most challenging conditions, including changes in government, lack of land for housing, and civil unrest, our hardworking staff -- 90 percent of whom are Haitians -- continue to meet the long-term needs of the Haitian people. While the pace of progress is never as fast as we would like, Haiti is better off today than it was five years ago," the Red Cross said.  The relief agency described several of the news account's assertions as "myths." About purportedly building only six new homes, the agency said it "has provided more than 132,000 people with safe and durable housing." "When we could not secure land to provide new housing, we focused on safe housing with a wide spectrum of choices, not a one-size-fits all plan (rental subsidies, repairs and retrofitting of existing homes, as well as teaching people how to repair their homes)," the Red Cross said in a statement. The news story relied on Red Cross internal documents, field reporting in Haiti and interviews with Haitian and former Red Cross officials, including the agency's former chief of the Haitian shelter program, Lee Malany. Malany quit after agency officials "did not seem to have any idea how to spend millions of dollars set aside for housing," according to the outlets' report.  The Red Cross also declined repeatedly to disclose details on how exactly money was spent in Haiti and instead provided only broad categories of expenditures, despite a pledge by CEO Gail McGovern that her agency would "lead the effort in transparency," the news report said. A CNN review of the Red Cross' tax filings from July 2010 to June 2014 shows no detailed expenditures for its numerous relief programs, including in Haiti. Those documents, called Form 990, do show details on salaries, including McGovern's $597,961 total compensation in the most recent filing. The Red Cross said it annually reports online how donor dollars are spent according to sector and seven priorities: emergency relief, shelter, health, water and sanitation, livelihoods, disaster preparedness, and cholera prevention. Accusations that "details of Red Cross spending are so broad as to be useless" is a myth, the agency said.  The Red Cross also disputed accusations about internal problems and delayed services and asserted that staff turnover rate was "relatively low" and "consistent" with other humanitarian organizations in Haiti. The agency said 91 cents of every donated dollar goes to programs and services, and partnering organizations also have low expenses. "It is more cost effective to rely on the expertise of partners than if we tried to build and staff these programs from scratch," the Red Cross said. A 7.0-magnitude earthquake killed between 230,000 and 316,000 people in Haiti in 2010 and left 1.5 million people displaced in the immediate aftermath. A subsequent cholera outbreak killed more than 8,500 people. In all, more than $13 billion in aid has been allocated to Haiti by multilateral and bilateral agencies from 2010 to 2020, according to the U.N. Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)Lionel Messi has urged his teammates to improve in Tuesday's Copa America clash with Uruguay after Argentina "fell asleep" against Paraguay. Messi's men blew a two-goal lead, drawing 2-2 in their opening Group B match of the South American championship in Chile, while titleholder Uruguay won 1-0 against guest nation Jamaica. "We played well in the first half, but we fell asleep in the second," said Messi, who scored a 36th-minute penalty soon after Sergio Aguero's opener in La Serena. Nelson Valdez reduced the deficit from long range on the hour mark and substitute Lucas Barrios snatched an equalizer in the final minute of regulation time. "We should have put the game to bed," said captain Messi, who came into the tournament after winning a treble of titles with European and Spanish champion Barcelona. "In the first half we completely dominated possession, but in the second Paraguay took the ball away from us. "Obviously it's frustrating to be held to a draw after being 2-0 up, but we have to move on, think about Uruguay and improve. We have to keep the ball a bit more and manage the game." Uruguay beat its larger neighbor Argentina on penalties in the quarterfinals on the way to winning the last Copa in 2011, but could only reach the round of 16 of the 2014 World Cup -- where Messi's side lost in the final. When they contested the World Cup qualifiers, Argentina won the home match 3-2 but lost 3-2 in Uruguay. Veteran midfielder Cristian Rodriguez netted the only goal against Jamaica in Antofagasta, as the Caribbean side acquitted itself well on debut in the tournament. Mexico is the other guest nation, making its ninth appearance. It drew 0-0 in its Group A opener against Bolivia on Friday. On Sunday, Colombia faces Venezuela before Brazil takes on Peru in the second Group C match. Who will win the Copa? Have your say on CNN FC's Facebook page  </corpo>

            <descricao>Brazilian great Zico is the latest former professional footballer intent on succeeding FIFA president Sepp Blatter.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Brazilian great Zico is the latest former professional footballer intent on succeeding FIFA president Sepp Blatter. Frenchman David Ginola and Portugal's Luis Figo both threw their hats into the ring ahead of last month's presidential election, only to both ultimately pull out of the race. Blatter went on to be re-elected for a fifth term, before announcing his resignation following the launch of separate investigations by the U.S. and Swiss authorities into alleged corruption within FIFA. The election of Blatter's successor is believed to be set for December, and former Brazil star Zico, whose full name is Arthur Antunes Coimbra, wants to shake up the way world football is run. "I would like to confirm the decision to be a candidate," Zico told a news conference in Rio de Janeiro. "I feel I am capable. For sure, certain rules need to change. "It's sad for our sport to see what is happening in football today -- the corruption... and the hard work of many other good people wasted. "I see it as my duty to use my experience and knowledge to try and stand for the presidency." Former France international Ginola, whose bid was controversially backed by betting company Paddy Power, withdrew from the presidential race in January after failing to receive the backing of five football federations required to stand in the election. The 48-year-old Ginola, however, has said in the wake of Blatter's resignation that he wants to put himself forward once again. Ex-Portugal captain Figo, meanwhile, pulled out just a week before the election, referring to the process as "a plebiscite for the delivery of absolute power to one man -- something I refuse to go along with." Zico, who represented his nation at three World Cups but never won the competition, admits he may also struggle to gather enough support like his fellow ex-professionals. "That need to have five federations behind you, I think that is where the corruption starts," said the Brazilian. "Of course, changes in the rules of the game would be necessary. Mainly because with the rules in place now there isn't the slightest possibility [of being elected]." Zico has little administrative experience in the world of football but said it was after speaking to Figo that he decided to stand for the role of FIFA president. "I was asked if I had talked with Figo about his being a candidate for FIFA," he said. "I said I had and that set me thinking." Considered one of Brazil's greatest ever players, Zico played most of his club football with Brazilian side Flamengo, before moving to play in Italy and Japan. The 62-year-old has also coached all over the world, taking charge of the Japan and Iraq national teams as well as the likes of Turkish side Fenerbahce and Russian club CSKA Moscow.  Meanwhile FIFA has handed over computer data to the Swiss authorities following a raid of the governing body's headquarters. Swiss authorities opened an investigation into corruption involving the bidding processes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups last month. The Swiss Office of the Attorney General (OAG) spokesperson confirmed the seizure of IT data to CNN. "Today, FIFA handed over seized IT Data to the OAG," a statement read. "As already communicated, the OAG has opened criminal proceedings against persons unknown. "The OAG is currently analyzing seized data and information. The OAG won't go into details as criminal proceedings are still under way." Reportedly Blatter is believed to be among those whose office was involved in the raid, while data from the offices of secretary general Jerome Valcke and the organization's financial chief Markus Kattner is also said to have been released to Swiss police.  Emirates CEO Tim Clark has also spoken out about his company's decision not to renew its sponsorship deal with FIFA in November. Clark said Emirates chose not to renew with FIFA because the commercial terms were not right, but added it could make a U-turn when Blatter departs and "if things are sorted out in FIFA." "We are glad we're not in the space at the moment because of the fallout over the last few weeks," Clark told CNN's Richard Quest. "It is a big pity, the big loser of course is football. Let's hope we can get it back onto some kind of track, it becomes the beautiful sport that it is, the sponsors are back in competing against each other to get on the tournament, because it is a hugely competitive battle to get that kind of exposure, but it's worth it." A number of current FIFA sponsors have warned the governing body to clean up its act in light of the corruption scandal, while Sony last week demanded an investigation into allegations over the controversial awarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.  </corpo>

            <descricao>Marta breaks the Women's World Cup scoring record with her 15th goal at the tournament.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)She's possibly the greatest soccer player you've never heard of. Marta has won virtually every individual and team honor available throughout her illustrious career -- and now the Brazilian has another record to add to her collection. Her penalty in Tuesday's 2-0 win over South Korea at the 2015 Women's World Cup propelled her to the top of the tournament's all-time goalscorer list with 15 goals. She surpassed retired Germany international Brigit Prinz and went two ahead of current USWNT star Abby Wambach who, at 35 years of age, is surely playing in her last World Cup. It was fitting that her record-breaking goal came from the penalty spot against South Korea, 12 years after her first for Brazil at a World Cup -- which, incidentally, was also a penalty against the same opposition. However, the one major trophy to evade the 29-year-old has been the World Cup. Widely regarded as the best female footballer of all time, can she really be considered the greatest ever without winning football's biggest prize? It is a question often asked about Argentina star Lionel Messi. Although, Marta has an international record and Ballon d'Or haul that would make even Messi's eyes water. Her goal on Tuesday took her to an incredible 92 goals in 93 matches for her country, while she has five FIFA World Player of the Year awards which came in consecutive years between 2006 and 2010. Often referred to as "the female Pele" -- and by Pele himself as "Pele with skirts" -- Marta has long been an advocate for equality in women's football. "I think it has changed a bit but that mentality still exists," she told CNN in 2013. "There's still prejudice and that resistance regarding women not only on female football but in various activities. "Men think that women are a bit fragile to perform some types of activities or don't have the ability and aren't strong enough. "That doesn't exist anymore. Women have shown they have capabilities in every sense better than men a lot of time, but it's that whole macho thing. "Football in Brazil is seen as a masculine sport, even with a lot of people accepting the female sport. There's still a percentage that thinks like in the old days." Despite there being undoubtedly a long way to go, a lot of progress has been made. In the USA, 3.3 million people tuned in to watch their team's opener against Australia, more than tripling the viewing figures from the first game at the previous World Cup. Similarly in England, television viewers peaked at 2.4 million during the country's 1-0 defeat against France, almost double the 1.3 million that watched them during the European Championship in 2013. Perhaps the most impressive figure came from the host nation Canada, whose 1.8 million viewers during their team's tournament opener against China made it the most watched Women's World Cup match ever in the country. "There is hope for the future," Marta said two years ago. With her exceptional talents and record-breaking achievements, she certainly forms a large part of that hope.  </corpo>

            <corpo>(CNN)A Brazilian man crooned and strummed his guitar while undergoing brain surgery in his home country. Anthony Kullkamp Dias, 33, sang six songs while the doctors performed surgery to remove his brain tumor, according to the Hospital Nossa Senhora da Conceicao. Dias played "Yesterday" by the Beatles, a few Brazilian songs and an original number called "Emanuel," which he dedicated to his son. He was awake and talking during the surgery to monitor and map the brain for possible injuries to areas that control motor function and speech, which might be affected by the removal of the tumor, doctors said. In an interview with CNN affiliate TV Globo, Dias said he found out about his brain tumor a few days before his son was born. The idea to play the guitar and sing during the surgery came the day before he was wheeled into the operating room. The banker has played the guitar for 20 years, and also plays the accordion, keyboards, trumpet and the flute. Dr. Jean Abreu Machado, the anesthesiologist and clinical director at the hospital, said the brain tissue does not have sensors to pain. However, the skin and other surrounding tissue do, causing an interesting challenge to doctors on how to "keep the patient awake and pain-free." Dias said he felt no pain and they removed 90% of his tumor.    </corpo>

            <descricao>A video of a 16-year-old being beaten and burned to death in the Guatemalan village of Rio Bravo goes viral online and spurs debate over vigilante justice.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)A large crowd stands by as a teenage girl -- beaten and bloodied -- writhes on the ground, her body engulfed in flames. "Add gasoline," someone shouts. The shocking scene from a Guatemalan village went viral online and has spurred a debate over what some describe as vigilante justice in the Central American country. Citing witnesses in the village of Rio Bravo, local media reported that the girl was beaten and burned to death for her alleged involvement in the killing of a taxi driver there earlier this month. Police told CNN they haven't verified the authenticity of the video. But they said they are investigating the circumstances leading up to the death of a 16-year-old girl who was set on fire in Rio Bravo, a small village two hours west of Guatemala's capital in the state of Suchitepequez. Guatemalan authorities have pointed to vigilante justice as a persistent problem, particularly in rural areas. After a wave of mob attacks last year, President Otto Perez Molina said it's a problem that results from a lack of enough police officers patrolling the population. But some analysts have suggested it's a matter of how little people trust police and other authorities, not how many officers are on the streets. So far this year, there have been more than 20 similar mob burnings in the country, according to Mario Polanco of Guatemala's Grupo de Apoyo Mutuo human rights organization. "It is unfortunate these types of situations occur," Polanco said. "They are produced by the weakness of the state's institutions to guarantee safety and justice for the population, and so (people) take justice into their own hands." Guatemala is one of the world's most violent countries, according to the United Nations, which created a commission in 2006 to investigate corruption and impunity there. Nearly every murder in Guatemala goes unsolved, and convictions are achieved in only about 6% of all criminal cases, the commission says on its website.  The video purporting to show the teen's death in Rio Bravo, which was posted on YouTube and numerous Guatemalan media websites, begins with an image of the girl stumbling with blood streaming down her face. A large crowd of people standing shoulder to shoulder watches as men and women slam her face into ground and kick her head. Then, someone sets her on fire and douses her with gasoline. Some in the crowd record the incident on their cell phones. No one steps in to put out the blaze. Residents who spoke with CNN affiliate Noti7 said the teenager in the video and two men robbed and shot dead a tax driver. The two men -- one of whom is believed to have fired the deadly shot -- escaped the crime scene, but a group of residents captured the girl and attacked her. Police eventually arrived at the scene, witnesses told Noti7, but the mob quickly turned on officers and blocked any attempts at rescue.  The Catholic Church and government officials have condemned the incident, Noti7 reported. And on social media and in the comments sections of local media reports about what happened, many people have blasted the town's residents. "They are just as much murderers as the those who killed the taxi driver," one person posted in response to an article about the incident on the Guatevision website. "May God pardon them. She was almost a girl. It hurts me to see that there was not even one good soul who helped this girl. Remember that we will all be measured by the same bar." But reactions have been mixed. Some have even applauded what they said was justice being served. "Let's see if all of you who are speaking out here would have defended this girl if she'd killed your son, mother, father or grandfather," another post on the Guatevision article said.

            <cabecalho>Why you should be watching Women's World Cup - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>It's a shame the Women's World Cup doesn't get the love the men's does. You're so missing out. </descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's a shame the Women's World Cup doesn't get the love the men's does. You're so missing out. The women play with a hunger that million-dollar prima donnas (read: Ronaldo) just can't always muster. The games aren't always a foregone conclusion (Long-shots like Australia can surprise you here). And your team can actually win this thing. (We're talking to you, U.S. and England). The tournament began Sunday and runs until July 5. The U.S. takes on Australia at 7:30 p.m. ET Monday. Still not convinced? Let us dispel some more doubts, so you'll give Women's World Cup a shot.  You know how some Americans complain that soccer's boring because there are so few goals? Not here. In the opener yesterday, Norway beat Thailand 4-0. And how many goals did Germany score against the goalless Ivory Coast? TEN! Yes, 10!  You know how in men's soccer, a strong wind is enough to knock a player over. And they play-act like a babies? The women don't have time for that. According to a study, women fake injury half as much as men do. And when they are on the ground rolling around, they're back up 30 seconds faster than men.  You know what the big controversy was, ahead of the 2014 men's World Cup in Brazil? In six of the 12 cities that hosted the games, the quality of the grass was poor and could really injure a player. Oh boo hoo! At least the men had grass. The women will play their games on synthetic turf. Turf burns are brutal. Legs are going to get beat up.  If you're an American, then get behind Team USA. While the men's team has made much progress, the women have won the World Cup not once (1991) but twice (1999) and came so close four years ago. Remember that iconic pic of Brandi Chastain celebrating? That was her after scoring the winning penalty kick against China, when she became every girl's soccer hero. If you're a Brit, your women's team could also make you proud (unlike Rooney and the boys). Plus, they're in a relatively easy group. And if you're German, your guys already won the men's World Cup last year. Why not make it a two-fer? Your gals are ranked #1 in the world.  We'll admit, it's hard to top Luis Suarez chomping down on an opponent. And that's a good thing in the women's game. It keeps the 'beautiful game' beautiful. But women's soccer has its share of drama. Remember this epic hair pull? Or what about when Colombia's Lady Andrade left a shiner on U.S.' Abby Wambach during the London Olympics?  Messi. Tevez. Neymar. You know them all. And you should. They're really, really good. You know who else is good? Abby Wambach. How good? Well, she's scored more goals for a national team than any other player in soccer history. And that includes women and men. Then there's Brazil's Marta, nicknamed "Pele with a skirt." Slightly sexist, we know. But it's meant as a compliment. She was named FIFA Woman's Player of the Year five times. She's yet to win a World Cup and you can bet, she'll be giving it her all.

            <cabecalho>FIFA and the revenge of the Women's World Cup - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>The next month of Women's World Cup could be an opportunity for FIFA to deflect attention away from its scandal and finally give women's soccer its due.</descricao>
            <corpo>Amy Bass, a professor of history at the College of New Rochelle, has written widely on the cultural history of sports, including the book "Not the Triumph but the Struggle: The 1968 Olympics and the Making of the Black Athlete." She is a veteran of eight Olympics as the supervisor of NBC's Olympic Research Room, for which she won an Emmy in 2012. Follow her on Twitter @bassab1. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN)For the past few weeks, soccer has held an unusually prominent place in U.S. headlines, although for scandal rather than action on the pitch. All the talk about bribes and politics and the squalid doings of world soccer's ruling body, FIFA, obscured a happier soccer story: Over the weekend in Canada, the elite women of the world took to the field to start the largest and longest Women's World Cup ever held -- 52 matches among 24 teams. And the American women are, as always, a top contender to take it all. The relative lack of attention paid to the Women's World Cup is no surprise. While it will take some time to see if the resignation of FIFA President Sepp Blatter has any effect on the organization's alleged shenanigans, one thing is sure: His downfall is nothing but good for the women's game. He has never been what one would call supportive. The popularity of women's soccer has grown under his tenure, but not for reasons he ever appeared to understand. "Let the women play in more feminine clothes like they do in volleyball," he famously said in 2004. "They could, for example, have tighter shorts." American superstar Alex Morgan says Blatter did not know who she was at the FIFA Player of the Year awards in 2013, where she was being honored as one of the top three in the world. Teammate Abby Wambach led a gender discrimination suit against FIFA over the issue of artificial turf, something Blatter and his cronies basically ignored until the women dropped the suit. Fans of the women's game are hoping that the tournament itself will become the focus in the coming weeks. But the lead-up to the Women's World Cup has always paled in comparison to the frenzy that surrounds the men, a sign of women's lack of status in international sport. Some, however, see the next month as an opportunity for FIFA to deflect attention onto the field. "In a strange way, the scandal can work to the benefit of the WWC," American soccer legend Alexi Lalas, an analyst for Fox Sports' coverage of the tournament, told me. "It is the perfect distraction and shield and it can come to represent the antithesis of the scandal. If I were FIFA, I would be steering and focusing everything and everyone towards the event. No one will forget the events of the last week, but if FIFA does it right, the WWC can at least provide a temporary escape." In a strange twist of events, then, maybe the scandal will finally allow the women to get their due. "FIFA is in the middle of a scandal of its own design, but if there is one thing that was made clear after the so-called turf debate, it's that the women's game is increasingly powerful, with or without FIFA," said Canadian soccer writer Keph Senett. "This popularity and fan loyalty is the fruits of women's labors -- the players -- not the organization. FIFA's comeuppance is just in time. It makes way for the fans to focus on top-notch sport played expertly by passionate professionals." This kind of star power is certainly true of the U.S. squad, which comes into the tournament as reigning Olympic champion. With Morgan and Wambach on the cover of Sports Illustrated, alongside teammates Carli Lloyd and Sydney Leroux, the hopes of the U.S. capturing its first crown since 1999 loom large and very possible. (Let's not talk about that heartrending shootout defeat to Japan four years ago.) The U.S. starts its march toward the July 5 final in Group D, squaring off Monday against Australia in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and then Sweden (June 12, Winnipeg) and Nigeria (June 16, Vancouver, British Columbia). If the team doesn't win its group -- and Australia's Lisa de Vanna and Nigeria's Asisat Oshoala are going to do their best to prevent it -- the road to an unprecedented third title will be more difficult, with powerful opponents such as Brazil and Japan waiting in the wings, and two-time champ Germany, ranked No. 1, looming ever larger, having crushed Ivory Coast in its opening match Sunday, a brutal 10-0. The Americans have their work cut out for them. While 15 members of the squad are World Cup vets, many of the stars, including Wambach and Morgan, have been fighting injuries of late. But there is hope that newbies such as Leroux, a power forward who has averaged the most goals in the fewest minutes of any U.S. women's national team member ever, will rise to the challenge. Last summer, Americans finally appeared to have caught World Cup fever: ESPN saw record-breaking numbers of viewers for U.S. games -- some 24.7 million watched the U.S. men's team square off against Portugal -- and fans found a legitimate rock star in goalie Tim Howard. While Fox Sports has seen heavy demand for advertising space, the women's tournament still poses the intriguing question: Will a chance for international glory be enough to get people to watch the women?

            <cabecalho>10 of the world's most amazing long-distance trails  - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Craving dehydrated food and days without washing? These epic hikes are for you.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)Long distance trails inspire contradictory tales of solitude and camaraderie, deserted river beds and mountain plateaus, pleasure and pain. The idea of covering thousands of miles on foot is itself barely believable. Perhaps that's what makes these adventures so memorable. Cheryl Strayed's memoir of her 1,000-mile trek along the U.S. Pacific Crest Trail was so enthralling it made it to Hollywood. "Wild," a film based on her account and starring Reese Witherspoon, was one of the most talked about releases at the end of 2014, with Witherspoon even nominated for a best actress award at the 2015 Golden Globes. If you'd like a piece of that action, or simply crave dehydrated food, days without washing and multiple, life-threatening encounters, then here are 10 other epic hikes ripe for big screen treatment. Who would play you? The Appalachian (United States) Distance: 3,510 kilometers (2,180 miles) The Appalachian is the grand dame of long-distance trails. One third of North America's holy hiking trinity, the Triple Crown -- the others being the Pacific Crest and Continental Divide trails -- it's the most iconic, famed for its "thru hikers" who attempt to complete it in a single season. Its 5 million steps follow the Appalachian Mountains from Mount Springer, Georgia, to Mount Katahdin, Maine. The range was once a natural border to the 13 colonies held by powerful Native American tribes like the Iroquois and Cherokee, before independence gave rise to westward expansion. Among the highlights: the idyllic, overgrown tracks through Great Smokey Mountains National Park in North Carolina, North America's most diverse forest. More information at: Appalachiantrail.org The South West Coast Path (UK) Distance: 1,016 kilometers (630 miles) The UK's longest National Trail is a stroll in the park compared to some of the other walks on our list, but what it lacks in longevity it makes up for in history. This dramatic coastal route from Minehead, Somerset, to Poole Harbour in Dorset, takes hikers around the tip of Cornwall, crisscrossing two World Heritage Sites including the famed Jurassic Coast. Nicknamed for its 240-million-year-old rocks, these prehistoric cliffs feature spectacular formations like Durdle Door and Ladram Bay. And while it may be shorter you'll still have to climb a total of 114,931 feet (35,031 meters or four times the height of Everest) to finish it. More information: Southwestcoastpath.com Te Araroa (New Zealand) Distance: 3,000 kilometers (1,864 miles) With a backdrop straight out of Middle Earth -- glacial ridges, windswept headlands, shires -- New Zealand's landscape doesn't disappoint. Te Araroa (Maori for "The long pathway") covers most of it; all the way from Cape Regina in the North to Bluff on the southern tip. "Tramping" the length of it, as the Kiwis would say, from the gentle bays of Queen Charlotte to the volcanic Mount Tongariro, takes about three months. Still, even at a fast pace you could be overtaken be overtaken. Ultramarathon runner Jezz Bragg completed it in a fantastical time of 53 days. More information: Teararoa.org.nz Continental Divide Trail (United States) Distance: 4,990 kilometers (3,100 miles) The third and longest installment of The Triple Crown is really a director's cut -- loved by serious trail enthusiasts but not for everyone. Spanning 3,100 miles from Mexico to Canada along the Rocky Mountain spine of North America, it takes hikers across some arduous but spectacular terrain including the Red Desert dunes of Wyoming and the heights of Grays Peak (14,270 feet/4,350 meters) in Colorado. The standout feature is Triple Divide Peak in Montana, where the rain runs three ways to the Pacific, the Atlantic and the Arctic via Hudson Bay. Only 150 people attempt to thru-hike the trail each year. The youngest to complete it was 13-year-old Reed Gjonnes. More information: Continentaldividetrail.org Sir Samuel and Lady Florence Baker Historical Trail (Sudan-Uganda) Distance: 805 kilometers (500 miles) Trail blazers have recaptured the spirit of discovery with this historic route, which retraces the expedition of Sir Samuel and Lady Florence Baker's -- the first Europeans to set eyes on Lake Albert and name it after Queen Victoria's late husband -- to that great African lake, 150 years ago. Starting near Juba, in South Sudan, the greater part runs through Uganda to Baker's View, over Lake Albert, and takes in natural wonders like Murchison Falls, which break the Nile with a 141-foot (43 meter) drop as it flows to Lake Victoria. More info: Thebakertrail.com Oregon Desert Trail (United States) Distance: 1,287 kilometers (800 miles) The Oregon High Desert is a thrilling, stark arena in which to test your mettle. The route is a moveable feast of shorter trails, historic wagon roads and swathes of wilderness to pioneer as you desire, or "bushwhack," as hiking enthusiasts call it. Not for the inexperienced, the isolation and scarcity of water over long sections pose a serious challenge, requiring significant backup resources. But it's not all desolation. There's a quiet beauty to the landscape, which blooms wherever there's moisture. The truly remote, red-rock Owyhee Canyonlands seem to crumble away as you wander through. More information: Onda.org Grand Italian Trail, Sentiero Italia (Italy) Distance: 6,166 kilometers (3,830 miles) There are "Great" trails and even "Greater" trails. The Sentiero is best described as "Grand." It's an indulgent, convalescent tour traversing the entire Alpine arc before shimmying down the Apennine chain to Sicily and finally drifting west across the Tyrrhenian to Sardinia and Santa Teresa Gallura -- site of the ancient city of Tibula. The route was forged in 1995 by the first Walk Italy event and gives not so much a taste but a full five courses of La Dolce Vita: from the majestic Dolomites, via rich Tuscan vineyards, to the jaw-dropping splendor of the Amalfi Coast. With such varied terrain and the sheer distances involved a thru-hike takes considerable planning and roughly eight months to complete. More information: Traildino.com Great Himalayan Trail (Nepal) Distance: 1,700 kilometers (1,056 miles) In a word: ambitious. Still being put together, when finished, this 4,500 kilometer (2,796 mile) skyscraping traverse will be the longest and highest mountain trail in the world, crossing the entire Himalaya range from Kashmir to Tibet, via India, Nepal and Bhutan. Nepal's section is the most complete and it alone offers one of the great trekking challenges. It's split into Low and High routes that run near parallel, beginning either side of Kanchenjunga Base Camp and ending on the Tibetan border in Humla. For high culture, the low route (still averaging 2,000 meters in height) passes through remote Nepali villages dotted along the hills and valleys. Only those with mountaineering experience should attempt the high route -- it peaks at a breathless 6,146 meters (20,164 feet). More information: Thegreathimalayatrail.org Hokkaido Nature Trail (Japan) Distance: 4,585 kilometers (2,849 miles) Japan is something of a distance-walking paradise, home to five of the world's 10 longest trails. At 2,849 miles and growing, this is the longest and last of them all, exploring the glaciers, forests and steaming, volcanic mountains of Hokkaido. Japan's northernmost island is roughly the size of Austria, with short balmy summers and long, cold winters. A complete tour takes seven months and is best divided by either side of winter. More information: Walkjapan.com Trans Panama Trail (Panama) Distance: 800 kilometers (497 miles) Anyone who has hiked in the tropics will testify to the difficult conditions. Sweaty, dense jungles, swarms of mosquitoes and numerous other bloodsucking creatures await and that's before you even begin this 500-mile journey. But the rewards are greater for those challenges. This cross-Panama route takes hikers from the border in Colombia to Costa Rica, and promises encounters with remote indigenous tribes like the Kuna and Embera. Hikers have a chance to canoe backwaters banked with lush rainforest and explore paths carved by conquistadors 600 years ago. Half complete in 2009, the whole route has now been mapped by Rick Morales, who himself completed it in just more than three months. More information: Transpanama.org  </corpo>

            <descricao>The United States officially removed Cuba from its list of countries that sponsor terrorism Friday, setting the two nations up for a full renewal of ties.</descricao>
            <corpo>Washington (CNN)The United States officially removed Cuba from its list of countries that sponsor terrorism on Friday, setting the two nations up for a full renewal of diplomatic ties. President Barack Obama originally announced in April that he was recommending that Cuba be removed from the terror blacklist after a State Department review. Friday marked the expiration of a 45-day period when Congress could have blocked the move. "The rescission of Cuba's designation as a State Sponsor of Terrorism reflects our assessment that Cuba meets the statutory criteria," the State Department said in a statement Friday. The statement noted that the U.S. "has significant concerns and disagreements with a wide range of Cuba's policies and actions" but said these fall outside the criteria related to rescinding a state sponsor of terror designation. READ: Shift in Cuba politics boosts Obama, challenges Rubio Cuba was originally placed on the terror list in 1982 when the U.S. government accused the Fidel Castro regime of sponsoring communist groups in Latin American and Africa. But independent analysts have for years cast doubt on the country's current terror ties, and the State Department said its association with certain groups had "become more distant." Three other countries are currently named as state sponsors of terror: Iran, Sudan and Syria. The terror listing was one of the final barriers to restoring diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba. Obama announced in December that he was ending a nearly half-century of frozen relations, stating that the freeze wasn't benefiting either nation. The administration has already lifted some of the restrictions on travel and trade with Cuba, including permitting some ferries to run services from Florida to the island. American visitors are still required to obtain a license from the federal government before traveling to Cuba, though the Treasury has made it easier to obtain permission to go. The removal of the terror designation will also ease some trade restrictions, though in order for full economic ties to be restored, Congress will need to lift the embargo on Cuba that's been in place since 1960. Some lawmakers -- including Republican and Democratic Cuban-Americans -- staunchly oppose any normalization in relations with Cuba, accusing Obama of sidling up to a brutal dictatorship. House Speaker John Boehner said on Friday that Obama "handed the Castro regime a significant political win in return for nothing" by removing Cuba from the terror list. "The communist dictatorship has offered no assurances it will address its long record of repression and human rights abuses at home," Boehner said in a statement. Despite the objections, neither Boehner not other opponents of Obama's Cuba policy sought to block the terror designation removal in Congress. A GOP congressional source said leaders anticipated that overcoming a presidential veto on the measure would be difficult, and determined the practical effects of the removal were minimal. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, an expected contender for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination, wrote in a statement that, "Neither continued repression at home nor Cuba's destabilizing activities abroad appear sufficient to stop President Obama from making further concessions to the Communist regime in Havana." READ: US 'optimistic' about upcoming normalization talks with Cuba White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest dismissed Republicans' concerns on the terror list removal and said the potential of Obama visiting Cuba remains a "presidential aspiration." In January Obama met with Cuban leader Raul Castro at the Summit of the Americans in Panama, the first time the leaders of the two countries had met for substantial talks since before the Cuban revolution. Visiting Miami on Thursday, Obama made a stop at the Shrine of Our Lady of Charity, a religious site honoring the patron saint of Cuba, to pay respects the large Cuban diaspora in the United States. Officials have been negotiating the reopening of embassies in Washington and Havana, though some sticking points -- like how freely American diplomats will be able to move around Cuba -- remain. The U.S. is eying the current head of the U.S. Interests Section in Cuba, Jeffrey DeLaurentis, as the first U.S. ambassador to Cuba in more than 50 years. Plans are being formulated to remodel the current building on Havana's waterfront that houses the interests section to use it as the embassy.

            <descricao>Former FIFA official Jack Warner scores an own-goal by citing an article by satirical news outlet The Onion in an attempt to defend himself against criminal charges.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)An embattled former FIFA official has scored a spectacular public relations own-goal by citing an article by satirical news outlet The Onion in an attempt to counter criminal charges against him. Jack Warner, FIFA's former vice-president and a member of parliament in Trinidad and Tobago, was among those arrested last week in a U.S.-led investigation into corruption in world football. He was released on bail Thursday and is facing an extradition request from the U.S. government. In a video statement posted Sunday to his own warnertv.net website and social media accounts, Warner brandished a copy of a bogus news report by the satirical news website as he launched a broadside against the ongoing U.S. Justice Department investigation into alleged bribe-taking and racketeering at football's governing body. The faux news report, titled "FIFA Frantically Announces 2015 Summer World Cup in the United States," jokingly suggested the sporting body had created an alternative tournament to appease U.S. officials. Warner accused the U.S. of "double standards" for agreeing to host the fictional tournament in cooperation with an organization it had accused of corruption. "If FIFA is so bad, why is it the U.S.A. wants to keep the FIFA World Cup?" he asks, pointing to a print-out of the report. READ MORE: FIFA in crisis -- who are the men who have been charged? He went on to elaborate his theory: "Why is it the U.S. authorities sought to embarrass FIFA in Zurich? Something has to be wrong. I made the point to you over and over that all this... has stemmed from the failed U.S. bid to host the World Cup." After Warner's blunder was ridiculed online, the video was removed from his social media accounts, only to be later replaced with an edited version, shorn of the reference to the Onion article. But a version of the original was reposted by a YouTube user. READ MORE: Blatter wins another term as FIFA president  Warner, head of Trinidad and Tobago's Independent Liberal Party, declared his innocence in the wake of last week's indictments and said in a statement that he had not been interviewed and "the actions of FIFA no longer concern me." In May 2011, Warner and fellow FIFA member Mohammed bin Hammam of Qatar were suspended by FIFA's Ethics Committee, pending the outcome of an investigation of corruption allegations against them. Warner resigned from his position the following month, and FIFA announced that "all Ethics Committee procedures against him have been closed and the presumption of innocence is maintained." On Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department unsealed information on people who had pleaded guilty to various charges relating to FIFA in recent years. They included Warner's sons Daryll, a former FIFA development officer who pleaded guilty in 2013 to two counts related to wire fraud and structuring of financial transactions, and Daryan, who has forfeited $1.1 million as part of his plea and will forfeit an undisclosed sum when he is sentenced for wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering conspiracy and the structuring of financial transactions.

            <cabecalho>15 best restaurants to eat at in 2015 - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Some of our favorite restaurants are heading East while others are perfecting their traditional cuisines at home.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's going to be a great year for global foodies. Some of the world's biggest restaurants are exporting their brands to other countries -- some permanently, others only temporarily -- while top chefs are opening exciting new ventures. Here are some restaurant openings and events we can't wait to experience, as well as a few classics worth revisiting. Santina (New York) The Mario Carbone, Jeff Zalaznick and Rich Torrisi partnership expands with the recent launch of Santina near the Highline in Manhattan. Despite the Meatpacking District location, the focus here is on seafood, along with the group's Italian cuisine, which has proved successful in their Carbone restaurants in both New York and Hong Kong. Santina is named after Mario's grandmother, so Sicily will be featured strongly on the menu. Santina, 820 Washington St., New York; +1 212 254 3000 The Fat Duck (Melbourne, Australia) Heston Blumenthal's groundbreaking Fat Duck is temporarily decamping from wintry Berkshire in the UK to sunnier climes in Melbourne, Australia. The relocation to The Crown Towers Hotel offers diners the same three-Michelin-star experience and menu as the original, promising "a multi-sensory phantasmagoria." You're out of luck though if you'd like a table -- all reservations for the six-month stint have already been filled via an online ballot system that's now closed. Time to work that network of yours for an invite. The Fat Duck will be in Melbourne from February 3 to August 15, 2015. The Fat Duck, Level 3 Crown Towers, 8 Whiteman St., Southbank, Melbourne, Australia; +61 3 9292 5778 Noma at The Mandarin Oriental Tokyo Great chefs apparently think alike -- Rene Redzepi's Copenhagen-based NOMA is also taking a break from Europe and heading East, in this case for a stint at Tokyo's Mandarin Oriental hotel from January 9 until February 14, 2015. Beef tartare with ants, reindeer moss with cep mushrooms and sea urchin and duck are among the 20 servings offered across both the lunch and dinner menus. Once again however the six-week visit has sold out. Noma, 2-1-1 Nihonbashi Muromachi, Chuo-ku, Tokyo; +81 3 3270 8800 Tivano, Temple House (Chengdu, China) With 14 million people, China's fourth most populous city is renowned as a gastronome's paradise for its often fiery but always nuanced Sichuan cuisine, available everywhere from street stalls to high-end restaurants. One missing piece in Chengdu has been high-end Western dining. That will change with the May opening of Italian restaurant Tivano in the city's new Temple House hotel that'll specialize in northern Italian cuisine and wines. Tivano, 81 Bitieshi St., Jinjiang District, Chengdu, China; +86 28 6636 9999 Flames, Four Seasons Hotel The Westcliff (Johannesburg) Joburg's venerable Westcliff Hotel, with views over jacaranda tree covered-hills and the elephants of the city's zoo, is reborn as The Four Seasons following a $50 million renovation. With it comes, Flames promises an authentic South African braai (barbecue) experience under chef Dirk Gieselmann. Specialties including boerewors and sosaties alongside kebabs and stellar steaks are accompanied by local beers and wines. Flames, Four Seasons Hotel, The Westcliff, 67 Jan Smuts Ave., Johannesburg; +27 11 481 6000  Chiltern Firehouse (London) Within days of opening, Chiltern Firehouse quickly became London's most talked about restaurant, bar and celebrity draw, a fixture of gossip columns. Dating from 1890, the building originally housed fire engines and now plays host to Portuguese chef Nuno Mendes' innovative cuisine with influences and ingredients from around the world. One downside of its popularity is that reservations can be hard to come by. Chiltern Firehouse, 1 Chiltern St., Marleybone, London; +44 20 7073 7676 Black Sheep (Manila, Philippines) One effect of the growing global appreciation of cuisine from the Philippines has been a restaurant renaissance in the capital Manila. Chef Jordy Navarra, a protege of the Fat Duck, is emblematic of the new wave. He's taken the Heston Blumenthal model of clever deconstruction of dishes and melded it with local Filipino produce, all in a dramatic penthouse setting overlooking the city. Black Sheep, Penthouse at W. 5th Ave., Taguig, Manila, Philippines; +63 2 478 4498 Restaurant David Toutain (Paris) Toutain's eponymous restaurant in the 7th arrondissement quickly won critical and customer acclaim for his inventive and unusual creations. Cauliflower mousse with coconut ice cream or fish with rhubarb and peas show that he isn't shy about pushing boundaries. The setting however is relaxed and un-stuffy and a world away from traditional French haute cuisine. Restaurant David Toutain, 29, Rue Surcouf, Paris; +33 1 45 50 1110 Corner House (Singapore) Jason Tan delivers what he calls "gastro-botanica," an approach that gives equal weight on the plate to protein and plants. The description is further understood given the restaurant's location in the Singapore Botanic Gardens. He reinterprets local dishes such as Kaya Toast. Ohers plates show his classical French training at Robuchon au Dome in Macau. Corner House, 1 Cluny Road, E J H Corner House, Singapore Botanic Gardens, Singapore; +65 6469 1000 Lasai (Rio de Janeiro) In a city more famous for its relaxed beach bars and street food, young chef Rafael Costa e Silva has opened Lasai in the city's Botafogo district. He trained at the legendary Mugaritz in San Sebastian so knows modernist cuisine and fine plating inside out, as reflected in the two tasting menus that feature produce from the restaurant's own gardens as well as the country's famously good meats. Lasai, Rua Conde de Iraja, 191,Rio de Janeiro; +55 21 3449 1834  Zazu (Quito, Ecuador) Zazu's bright, sleek main dining room has a buzzy, laid back international feel, with a clientele to match. Any Ecuadorean will proudly insist that ceviche is their country's national dish, not Peru's. One option at Zazu features local stone crab served with olive oil, chili and, of course, lime juice. The suckling pig tacos might be an even better choice. Zazu, Mariano Aguilerra 331 y La Pradera, Quito, Ecuador; +593 2 254 3559 Statholdergaarden (Oslo, Norway) Bent Stiansen is a titan of Norway's food scene and a former holder of the hugely prestigious Bocuse d'Or. He uses the country's extraordinary natural bounty to maximum effect, with shellfish and other seafood often at the forefront of his six-course Michelin-starred menu. The dining room features crystal, porcelain, chandeliers and fresh flowers under a remarkable stucco ceiling. Statholdergaarden, Radhusgata 11, Oslo; +47 22 41 88 00 Waterside Inn (Bray, UK) Few restaurants are as charming as Michel Roux's legendary Waterside Inn on the banks of the Thames in the culinary hotspot of Bray. It's a temple of French gastronomy, a three Michelin-starred pantheon of la cuisine classique now helmed by Michel's son Alain and run with faultless hospitality from the amuse-bouche through to the petit four. Waterside Inn, Ferry Road, Bray, West Berkshire, United Kingdom; +44 1628 620 691 Amber, The Landmark Mandarin Oriental (Hong Kong) Under Dutch maestro Richard Ekkebus, Amber at the Landmark Mandarin has gone from strength to strength. The mystery for serious diners is why he's not been awarded an elusive but thoroughly merited third Michelin star to join the two he's held for a decade. Ekkebus takes classic French technique and execution and throws in global flavors and produce to deliver often brilliantly innovative dishes, delivering an atlas of exemplary cuisine on a plate. Amber, The Landmark Mandarin Oriental, 15 Queen's Road Central, Hong Kong; +852 2132 0066 Chez Panisse (Berkeley, California) Few chefs have had as much impact on contemporary American cuisine as Alice Waters. She opened Chez Panisse back in 1971 and espoused a philosophy that has now become mainstream, namely to eat local, seasonal produce wherever possible. Her legendary Berkeley restaurant is a warm, inviting temple to this thinking where the ingredients do the talking for a menu that changes daily. Chez Panisse, 1517 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley, California; +1 510 548 5525 Chris Dwyer is a Hong Kong-based communications consultant and food writer.

            <cabecalho>Lost comet lander Philae sends 'hello' from space - CNN.com</cabecalho>
            <descricao>Philae is alive! The lost comet lander from the Rosetta spacecraft signals ESA's operations center in Germany.</descricao>
            <corpo>(CNN)It's alive! Many moons ago, a small space probe named Philae skipped across the surface of Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko when the lander's harpoon-like anchoring mechanism failed. It came to rest in a shady spot and, without enough sunlight to keep it powered, it fell asleep after about 60 hours of operation. Mission scientists had been trying to pinpoint its location since November -- until late Saturday. At 10:28 p.m., the European Space Agency's operations center in Darmstadt, Germany, just south of Frankfurt, received a signal from Philae, which transmitted more than 300 data packets. Those have been analyzed at the Lander Control Center at the German Aerospace Center, which dubbed Philae's emergence from its seven-month slumber a "'hello' from space." "Philae is doing very well. It has an operating temperature of -35ºC and has 24 watts available," Philae project manager Stephan Ulamec said in a statement. "The lander is ready for operations." To hear Twitter tell it, Philae's comet-chasing mothership, Rosetta, was delighted to hear from the little lander but reluctant to let it delve back into work too hastily after its long sleep. Rosetta and Philae's love affair on Twitter "Hello @ESA_Rosetta! I'm awake! How long have I been asleep? #Lifeonacomet," came the tweet from Philae's handle. "Hello @Philae2014! You've had a long sleep, about 7 months!" Rosetta responded. "Wow @ESA_Rosetta! That's a long time... time for me to get back to work! #Lifeonacomet" "@Philae2014 Need to check you're fit, healthy and warm enough first @philae2014! Take it easy for now :)" "Oh, OK @ESA_Rosetta! I'm still a bit tired anyway... talk to you later! Back to #lifeonacomet!" Months after Philae nodded off, lander system engineer Laurence O'Rourke told CNN that Philae needed almost 6 watts of power to reboot itself, 9 watts to accept communications and 19 watts to allow two-way communication with the orbiter -- not a great deal of power when you consider energy-saving lightbulbs use 20 watts or fewer. There was speculation in March that Philae could be awake but lacking the necessary power to communicate with Rosetta, which was in orbit around Comet 67P looking for the washing machine-sized lander. Scientists sent "blind commands" in hopes that the lander could process the instructions even if it couldn't respond, O'Rourke told CNN in March. But there was not immense confidence that Philae could be revived. Asked his thoughts Sunday, O'Rourke told CNN he was "thrilled" contact was re-established, which "allows us to do more science." "We are all delighted -- delighted that Philae survived the long winter. It's a great opportunity," he said. When the lander snapped its hibernation spell Saturday, it "spoke" with the scientists on the ground for 85 seconds, ESA said. "We have also received historical data -- so far, however, the lander had not been able to contact us earlier," Ulamec said, explaining that Philae must have been awake before Saturday night. Scientists eagerly anticipate Philae's next contact, as the lander's memory still contains more than 8,000 data packets that will tell them what has happened in recent days on Comet 67P. Since March 12, Rosetta has been listening for the lander to determine if it had survived the cold, dark recesses of the comet. Scientists promised that if enough sunlight could fall on Philae's solar panels, it could be revived. Problems began for the lander when devices designed to anchor Philae to the surface failed. The gravity is so weak that without the harpoons intended to fire from the feet, the probe bounced across the comet. The mishap, said scientists, could prove to be a happy accident. Had Philae touched down in its original landing spot, O'Rourke explained, the temperatures as the comet neared the sun could have burned out the lander's electronics, killing it altogether. But because it found shade -- beneath a cliff face, scientists deduced from images sent by the lander -- it was able to survive. Now, scientists are excited at the prospect of Philae witnessing a remarkable show as 67P makes its closest approach to the sun in August. "I think we are going to see some amazing images at that point," O'Rourke has said. ESA has led the consortium, which includes NASA, to find out more about the composition of comets and how they interact with the sun. The mission is already changing perceptions of comets. Instead of thinking of a comet as a dirty snowball, O'Rourke has said, he now thinks of a comet as an "icy dirtball." He also described discoveries of dust and large "boulders" circling the comet after they were blown off by the sun during previous orbits, and an image that appears to show a structure the size of a football field that has been lifted and deposited next to the hole. "The Rosetta mission is not just about the lander. It's about orbiting and following a comet -- watching it wake up and then go to sleep again, finding the secrets held by comets. Every day is a new discovery," he said. CNN Interactive: Rosetta and its mission Opinion: How comet mission helps search for alien life  </corpo>
